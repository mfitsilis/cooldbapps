1;World;Globally, the 20th century was marked by: (a) two devastating world wars;The surface of the earth is approximately 70.9% water and 29.1% land. The former portion is divided into large water bodies termed oceans. The World Factbook recognizes and describes five oceans, which are in decreasing order of size: the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean.<br />The land portion is generally divided into several, large, discrete landmasses termed continents. Depending on the convention used, the number of continents can vary from five to seven. The most common classification recognizes seven, which are (from largest to smallest): Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Asia and Europe are sometimes lumped together into a Eurasian continent resulting in six continents. Alternatively, North and South America are sometimes grouped as simply the Americas, resulting in a continent total of six (or five, if the Eurasia designation is used).<br />North America is commonly understood to include the island of Greenland, the isles of the Caribbean, and to extend south all the way to the Isthmus of Panama. The easternmost extent of Europe is generally defined as being the Ural Mountains and the Ural River;;;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/political/pdf/world.pdf">Political Map of the World</a><br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/world.pdf">Physical Map of the World</a><br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/time_zones.pdf">Standard Time Zones of the World</a><br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/world_oceans.pdf">World Oceans</a>;<i>total: </i>510.072 million sq km<br /><i>land: </i>148.94 million sq km<br /><i>water: </i>361.132 million sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>70.9% of the world's surface is water, 29.1% is land;land area about 16 times the size of the US<br /><i>top fifteen World Factbook entities ranked by size: </i>Pacific Ocean 155.557 million sq km;the land boundaries in the world total 251,060 km (not counting shared boundaries twice);356,000 km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>95 nations and other entities are islands that border no other countries, they include: American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Baker Island, Barbados, Bermuda, Bouvet Island, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cabo Verde, Cayman Islands, Christmas Island, Clipperton Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Comoros, Cook Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Cuba, Curacao, Cyprus, Dominica, Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Faroe Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Greenland, Grenada, Guam, Guernsey, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Howland Island, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jamaica, Jan Mayen, Japan, Jarvis Island, Jersey, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mayotte, Federated States of Micronesia, Midway Islands, Montserrat, Nauru, Navassa Island, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Norfolk Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Palmyra Atoll, Paracel Islands, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Helena, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Solomon Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Spratly Islands, Sri Lanka, Svalbard, Tokelau, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Virgin Islands, Wake Island, Wallis and Futuna, Taiwan;a variety of situations exist, but in general, most countries make the following claims measured from the mean low-tide baseline as described in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea: territorial sea -

Financial stabilization and stimulus programs that started in 2009-11, combined with lower tax revenues in 2009-10, required most countries to run large budget deficits. Treasuries issued new public debt - totaling $9.1 trillion since 2008 - to pay for the additional expenditures. To keep interest rates low, most central banks monetized that debt, injecting large sums of money into their economies - between December 2008 and December 2013 the global money supply increased by more than 35%. Governments now are faced with the difficult task of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and financial stability. And when economic activity picks up, central banks will confront the difficult task of containing inflation without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further growth.<br />Fiscal and monetary data for 2012 are currently available for 180 countries, which together account for 98.5% of World GDP. Of the 180 countries, 85 pursued unequivocally expansionary policies, boosting government spending while also expanding their money supply relatively rapidly - faster than the world average of 4.1%;$87.25 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$84.83 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$82.25 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;GWP (gross world product): $74.31 trillion (2013 est.);2.9% (2013 est.)<br />3.1% (2012 est.)<br />3.8% (2011 est.);$13,100 (2013 est.)<br />$12,800 (2012 est.)<br />$12,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>62%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>18.5%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>19.4%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.5%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>29.3%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-29.7%<br />(2011 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>6%<br /><i>industry: </i>30.7%<br /><i>services: </i>63.3% (2013 est.);;dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical equipment;3.5% (2013 est.);3.308 billion (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>34.5%<br /><i>industry: </i>22.7%<br /><i>services: </i>42.8% (2009 est.);8.4% (2013 est.)<br />7.5% (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries;<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.8%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>28.2% (2008 est.);;38.5 (2008 est.)<br />37.3 (1999 est.);<i>revenues: </i>$22.41 trillion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$24.6 trillion (2013 est.);30.3% of GDP (2013 est.);-3.1% of GDP (2013 est.);63.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />62.8% of GDP (2012 est.);;world average 3.9% (2013 est.)<br />developed countries 1.5% (2013 est.)<br />developing countries 5.6% (2013 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>the above estimates are weighted averages;;;$27.49 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$26.67 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);$82.84 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$79.31 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);$87.9 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$86.03 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);$53.87 trillion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$47.13 trillion (31 December 2011)<br />$54.61 trillion (31 December 2010 est.);;$18.71 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$18.59 trillion (2012 est.);the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services<br /><i>top ten -

2;Algeria;After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has largely dominated politics since. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting led the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. He was reelected to a second term in 2004 and overwhelmingly won a third term in 2009, after the government amended the constitution in 2008 to remove presidential term limits. Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA, including large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing activities of extremist militants. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) in 2006 merged with al-Qa'ida to form al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, which has launched an ongoing series of kidnappings and bombings targeting the Algerian Government and Western interests. The government in 2011 introduced some political reforms in response to the Arab Spring, including lifting the 19-year-old state of emergency restrictions and increasing women's quotas for elected assemblies. Parliamentary elections in May 2012 and municipal and provincial elections in November 2012 saw continued dominance by the FLN, with Islamist opposition parties performing poorly. Political protest activity in the country remained low in 2013, but small, sometimes violent socioeconomic demonstrations by disparate groups continued to be a common occurrence. Parliament in 2014 is expected to revise the constitution.;;Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia;28 00 N, 3 00 E;<a

In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Strong revenues from hydrocarbon exports have brought Algeria relative macroeconomic stability, with foreign currency reserves approaching $200 billion and a large budget stabilization fund available for tapping. In addition, Algeria's external debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. However, Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. The government's efforts have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases, moves which continue to weigh on public finances. Long-term economic challenges include diversifying the economy away from its reliance on hydrocarbon exports, bolstering the private sector, attracting foreign investment, and providing adequate jobs for younger Algerians.;$284.7 billion (2013 est.)<br />$276.2 billion (2012 est.)<br />$267.4 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$215.7 billion (2013 est.);3.1%

3;Angola;Angola is still rebuilding its country since the end of a 27-year civil war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but fighting picked up again in 1993. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people displaced - during the more than a quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and cemented the MPLA's hold on power.

international prices for its oil. Angola became a member of OPEC in late 2006 and its current assigned a production quota of 1.65 million barrels a day (bbl/day). Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond exports contribute an additional 5%. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 17% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left from the war still mar the countryside, even though peace was established after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Since 2005, the government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China, Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to rebuild Angola's public infrastructure. The global recession that started in 2008 temporarily stalled economic growth. Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global recession slowed GDP growth to 2.4% in 2009, and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008 and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November 2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to rebuild international reserves. Consumer inflation declined from 325% in 2000 to about 10% in 2012. Higher oil prices have helped Angola turn a budget deficit of 8.6% of GDP in 2009 into an surplus of 12% of GDP in 2012.

Growth in real output had averaged almost 4% before the global recession and it has returned to roughly that level in 2011-12. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307 million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006. The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications, water, electricity, and agriculture. The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production. Private foreign direct investment is small, and foreign aid accounts for the majority of investment in infrastructure projects. Cotton, a key export, suffered from flooding in 2010-11, but high prices supported export earnings. The government agreed to a 25% increase in civil servant salaries in 2011, following a series of strikes, increasing pressure on the national budget.

Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining, dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.;;Southern Africa, north of

However, economic growth was negative in 2009, with the industrial sector shrinking by 30%, after the global crisis reduced demand for Botswana's diamonds. Although the economy recovered in 2010, GDP growth has again slowed. Through fiscal discipline and sound management, Botswana transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $16,400 in 2013. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues. Botswana's heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism, financial services, subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors. According to official government statistics, unemployment reached 17.8% in 2009, but unofficial estimates run much higher. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is second highest in the world and threatens Botswana's impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in diamond production within the next two decades overshadows long-term prospects. A major international diamond company signed a 10-year deal with Botswana in 2012 to move its rough stone sorting and trading division from London to Gaborone by the end of 2013. The move may support Botswana's downstream diamond industry.;$34 billion (2013 est.)<br />$32.71 billion (2012 est.)<br />$31.4 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$15.53 billion (2013 est.);3.9% (2013 est.)<br />4.2% (2012 est.)<br />6.1% (2011 est.);$16,400 (2013 est.)<br />$15,900 (2012 est.)<br />$15,500 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;33.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />28.9% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />41.1% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>51.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>18.3%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>34.1%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>-1.2%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>47%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-49.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>35.7%<br /><i>services: </i>62.4% (2013 est.);livestock, sorghum, maize, millet, beans, sunflowers, groundnuts;diamonds, copper, nickel, salt, soda ash, potash, coal, iron ore, silver;7.2% (2013 est.);1.308 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>NA%<br /><i>industry: </i>NA%<br /><i>services: </i>NA%;17.8% (2009 est.)<br />7.5% (2007 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;30.3% (2003);63 (1993);<i>revenues: </i>$5.04 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$4.952 billion (2013 est.);32.4% of GDP (2013 est.);0.6% of GDP (2013 est.);17.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />17.4% of GDP (2012 est.);1 April - 31 March;6.1% (2013 est.)<br />7.5% (2012 est.);9.5% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />10% (31 December 2009 est.);10% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />11% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.517 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.358 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$8.293 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$7.635 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.38 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.111 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$4.588 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$4.107 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$4.076 billion (31 December 2010 est.);$1.375 billion (2013 est.)<br />-$795.2 million (2012 est.);$7.569 billion (2013 est.)<br />$6.011 billion (2012 est.);diamonds, copper, nickel, soda ash, meat, textiles;;$7.389 billion (2013 est.)<br />$7.918 billion (2012 est.);foodstuffs, machinery, electrical goods, transport equipment, textiles, fuel and petroleum products, wood and paper products, metal and metal products;;$7.933 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$7.628 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.416 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.443 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;;pulas (BWP) per US dollar -<br />8.732 (2013 est.)<br />7.6181 (2012 est.)<br />6.7936 (2010 est.)<br />7.1551 (2009)<br />6.7907 (2008);;429.6 million kWh (2010 est.);3.118 billion kWh (2011 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);2.985 billion kWh (2010 est.);132,000 kW (2011 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);15,420 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);19,360 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);3.843 million Mt (2011 est.);160,500 (2012);3.082 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>Botswana is participating in regional development efforts;2 TV stations - 1 state-owned and 1 privately owned;.bw;1,806 (2012);120,000 (2009);;74 (2013);<i>total: </i>10<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>2<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>6<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>64<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>5<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>46<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>13 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>888 km<br /><i>narrow gauge: </i>888 km 1.067-m gauge (2008);<i>total: </i>17,916 km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes 8,916 km of Public Highway Network roads (6,116 km paved and 2,800 km unpaved) and other 9,000 km of District Council roads (2011);;;;;Botswana Defense Force (BDF): Ground Forces Command, Air Wing Command, Defense Logistics Command, Special Forces Group (2013);18 is the legal minimum age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>557,647<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>531,095 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>340,949<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>302,332 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>23,649<br /><i>female: </i>23,063 (2010 est.);2.31% of GDP (2012)<br />2.43% of GDP (2011)<br />2.31% of GDP (2010);;none;;;

About 90% of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are key exports. Since 1998, Burkina Faso has begun to privatize state-owned enterprises and in 2004 revised its investment code to attract foreign investment. As a result, the country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and export. The Burkinabe economy experienced high levels of growth over the last few years but growth is highly dependent on swings in gold and cotton prices. In 2013 Burkina Faso experienced a number of public protests over the cost of living, corruption, and other socioeconomic issues. To defuse tensions the government has offered higher housing bonuses, reduced income taxes, and price controls. Turmoil in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose longer-term challenges.;$26.51 billion (2013 est.)<br />$24.9 billion (2012 est.)<br />$22.85 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$12.13 billion (2013 est.);6.5% (2013 est.)<br />9% (2012 est.)<br />5% (2011 est.);$1,500 (2013 est.)<br />$1,400 (2012 est.)<br />$1,300 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;12.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />14.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />16.6% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>55.2%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16.9%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>18.3%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.2%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>34.4%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-25%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>33.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>23.6%<br /><i>services: </i>42.8% (2013 est.);cotton, peanuts, shea nuts, sesame, sorghum, millet, corn, rice;cotton lint, beverages, agricultural processing, soap, cigarettes, textiles, gold;6.5% (2013 est.);6.668 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>a large part of the male labor force migrates annually to neighboring countries for seasonal employment (2007);<i>agriculture: </i>90%<br /><i>industry and services: </i>10% (2000 est.);77% (2004);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.9%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>32.2% (2009 est.);46.7% (2009 est.);39.5 (2007)<br />48.2 (1994);<i>revenues: </i>$2.838 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$3.228 billion (2013 est.);23.4% of GDP (2013 est.);-3.2% of GDP (2013 est.);;calendar year;2.1% (2013 est.)<br />3.8% (2012 est.);4.25% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />4.25% (31 December 2009 est.);NA%;$2.22 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.845 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$4.211 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.343 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.711 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.123 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$364.9 million (2013 est.)<br />-$247.6 million (2012 est.);$2.844 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.746 billion (2012 est.);gold, cotton, livestock;China 25.9%, Turkey 24.8%, Belgium 5.2% (2012);$2.941 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.675 billion (2012 est.);capital goods, foodstuffs, petroleum;Cote dIvoire 17.6%, France 15.2%, Ghana 4.8%, Togo 4.4% (2012);$1.115 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.025 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.863 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.607 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;;Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -<br />500.7 (2013 est.)<br />510.53 (2012 est.)<br />495.28 (2010 est.)<br />472.19 (2009)<br />447.81 (2008);;670 million kWh (2010 est.);773.1 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);150 million kWh (2010 est.);252,000 kW (2010 est.);87.3% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);12.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);9,960 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);11,660 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.454 million Mt (2011 est.);141,400 (2012);9.98 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>system includes microwave radio relay, open-wire, and radiotelephone communication stations;2 TV stations - 1 state-owned and 1 privately owned;.bf;1,795 (2012);178,100 (2009);;23 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>21<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>3<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>13<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>5 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>622 km<br /><i>narrow gauge: </i>622 km 1.000-m gauge<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>another 660 km of this railway extends into Cote d'Ivoire (2008);<i>total: </i>15,272 km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>does not include urban roads (2010);;;;;Army, Air Force of Burkina Faso (Force Aerienne de Burkina Faso, FABF), National Gendarmerie (2011);18 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>3,735,735 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>2,366,168<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>2,367,673 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>193,905<br /><i>female: </i>191,662 (2010 est.);1.39% of GDP (2012)<br />1.34% of GDP (2011)<br />1.39% of GDP (2010);;adding to illicit cross-border activities, Burkina Faso has issues concerning unresolved boundary alignments with its neighbors;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>32,170 (Mali) (2014);;
7;Burundi;Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. More than 200,000 Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that led to an integrated defense force, established a new constitution in 2005, and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The government of President Pierre NKURUNZIZA, who was reelected in 2010, continues to face many political and economic challenges.;;Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo;3 30 S, 30

The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.

Still, it faces many of the serious problems confronting other underdeveloped countries, such as stagnant per capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, endemic corruption, and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. Subsidies for electricity, food, and fuel have strained the budget. Cameroon has several large infrastructure projects under construction, including a deep sea port in Kribi and the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project. It also recently opened a natural gas powered electricity generating plant. Cameroon must attract more investment to improve its inadequate infrastructure, but its business environment is a deterrent to foreign investment.;$53.16 billion (2013 est.)<br />$50.85 billion (2012 est.)<br />$48.62 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$27.88 billion (2013 est.);4.6% (2013 est.)<br />4.6% (2012 est.)<br />4.1% (2011 est.);$2,400 (2013 est.)<br />$2,400 (2012 est.)<br />$2,300 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;21.6% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />21% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />19.8% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>65.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>21.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>31.7%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-35%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>20.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>27.3%<br /><i>services: </i>52.1% (2013 est.);coffee, cocoa, cotton, rubber, bananas, oilseed, grains, cassava (manioc, tapioca);petroleum production and refining, aluminum production, food processing, light consumer goods, textiles, lumber, ship repair;4.1% (2013 est.);8.426 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>70%<br /><i>industry: </i>13%<br /><i>services: </i>17% (2001 est.);30% (2001 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.3%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>35.4% (2001);48% (2000 est.);44.6 (2001)<br />47.7 (1996);<i>revenues: </i>$5.089 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$6.28 billion (2013 est.);18.3% of GDP (2013 est.);-4.3% of GDP (2013 est.);16.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />16.1% of GDP (2012 est.);1 July -

The agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP. Timber and diamonds account for most export earnings, followed by cotton. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. Factional fighting between the government and its opponents remains a drag on economic revitalization. Since 2009 the IMF has worked closely with the government to institute reforms that have resulted in some improvement in budget transparency, but other problems remain. The government's additional spending in the run-up to the election in 2011 worsened CAR's fiscal situation. Distribution of income is extraordinarily unequal. Grants from France and the international community can only partially meet humanitarian needs. In 2012 the World Bank approved $125 million in funding for transport infrastructure and regional trade, focused on the route between CAR's capital and the port of Douala in Cameroon. After a two year lag in donor support, the IMF's first review of CAR's extended credit facility for 2012-15 praised improvements in revenue collection but warned of weak management of spending.;$3.336

11;Chad;Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three decades of civil warfare, as well as invasions by Libya, before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite several peace agreements between the government and the insurgents. In 2005, new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in December 2006 and October 2007. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a significant insurrection in early 2008, but has had no significant rebel threats since then, in part due to Chad's 2010 rapprochement with Sudan, which previously used Chadian rebels as proxies. DEBY in 2011 was reelected to his fourth term in an election that international observers described as proceeding without incident. Power remains in the hands of an ethnic minority. In January 2014, Chad began a two year rotation on the UN Security Council.;;Central Africa, south of Libya;15 00 N, 19 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/africa.pdf">Africa</a>;<i>total: </i>1.284 million sq km<br /><i>land: </i>1,259,200 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>24,800 sq km;slightly more than three times the size of California;<i>total: </i>6,406 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Cameroon 1,116 km, Central African Republic 1,556 km, Libya 1,050 km, Niger 1,196 km, Nigeria 85 km, Sudan 1,403 km;0 km (landlocked);none (landlocked);tropical in south, desert in north;broad, arid plains in center, desert in north, mountains in northwest, lowlands in south;<i>lowest point: </i>Djourab 160 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Emi Koussi 3,415 m;petroleum, uranium, natron, kaolin, fish (Lake Chad), gold, limestone, sand and gravel, salt;<i>arable land: </i>3.82%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.02%<br /><i>other: </i>96.16% (2011);302.7 sq km (2003);43 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>0.88 cu km/yr (12%/12%/76%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>84.81 cu m/yr (2005);hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds occur in north;inadequate supplies of potable water;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping;<i><b>note 1:</b> </i>Chad is largest of Africa's 16 landlocked countries<br /><i><b>note 2:</b> </i>not long ago -

At least 80% of Chad's population relies for its livelihood on subsistence farming and livestock raising and oil provides the bulk of export revenues. Cotton, cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export earnings. Remittances have also been an important source of income and Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for most public and private sector investment. Oil production came on stream in late 2003 and Chad began to export oil in 2004. Economic growth has been positive in recent years due to high oil prices and strong local harvests, but Chad’s fiscal situation is repeatedly exposed to declining oil prices and drought . Recently, the economy has been strained by the costs of repatriating Chadians fleeing the violence in South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Chad's investment climate remains challenging due to limited infrastructure, a lack of trained workers, extensive government bureaucracy, and corruption.;$28 billion (2013 est.)<br />$26.94 billion (2012 est.)<br />$24.74 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$13.59 billion (2013 est.);3.9% (2013 est.)<br />8.9% (2012 est.)<br />0.1% (2011 est.);$2,500 (2013 est.)<br />$2,500 (2012 est.)<br />$2,400 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;46.4% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />45.6% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />45.4% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>25.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>12.2%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>53%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.3%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>32%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-23.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>46.3%<br /><i>industry: </i>9.9%<br /><i>services: </i>43.8% (2013 est.);cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, rice, potatoes, cassava (manioc, tapioca), cattle, sheep, goats, camels;oil, cotton textiles, meatpacking, brewing, natron (sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials;10% (2013 est.);4.293 million (2007);<i>agriculture: </i>80%<br /><i>industry and services: </i>20% (2006 est.);NA%;<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.6%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>30.8% (2003);80% (2001 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$2.753 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$3.557 billion (2013 est.);20.3% of GDP (2013 est.);-5.9% of GDP (2013 est.);30.5% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />31.3% of GDP (2012 est.);calendar year;4.5% (2013 est.)<br />10.2% (2012 est.);4.25% (31 December 2009)<br />4.75% (31 December 2008);15.5% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />15.5% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.598 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.442 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.804 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.559 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$832.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />NA% (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$827.1 million (2013 est.)<br />-$378.9 million (2012 est.);$3.865 billion (2013 est.)<br />$4.126 billion (2012 est.);oil, cattle, cotton, gum arabic;US 81.9%, China 6.7% (2012);$2.701 billion (2013 est.)<br />$NA (2012 est.);machinery and transportation equipment, industrial goods, foodstuffs, textiles;China 20.2%, Cameroon 18.2%, France 16.1%, Saudi Arabia 5.6%, US 4.2% (2012);$1.304 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.174 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.828 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.794 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA<br />$4.5 billion (2006 est.);$NA;Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs (XAF) per US dollar -<br />500.7 (2013 est.)<br />510.53 (2012 est.)<br />495.28 (2010 est.)<br />472.19 (2009)<br />447.81 (2008);;98 million kWh (2010 est.);91.14 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);31,000 kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);104,500 bbl/day (2012 est.);125,700 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1.5 billion bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,817 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,754 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);999.5 billion cu m (1 January 2012 est.);289,800 Mt (2011 est.);29,900 (2012);4.2 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>inadequate system of radiotelephone communication stations with high costs and low telephone density<br /><i>domestic: </i>fixed-line connections for less than 1 per 100 persons coupled with mobile-cellular subscribership base of only about 35 per 100 persons<br /><i>international: </i>country code -

12;Comoros;Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups since gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI seized power of the entire government in a bloodless coup, and helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each island maintains its local government. AZALI won the 2002 federal presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected its president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI was elected to office. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession from the Union of Comoros, refusing to step down when Comoros' other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but in March 2008 the AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The island's inhabitants generally welcomed the move. In May 2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in peaceful elections widely deemed to be free and fair.;;Southern Africa, group of islands at the northern mouth of the Mozambique Channel, about

13;Congo, Democratic Republic of the;Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the then-Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. In January 2001, KABILA was assassinated and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying the eastern DRC;;Central Africa, northeast of Angola;0 00 N, 25 00 E;<a

Systemic corruption since independence in 1960, combined with country-wide instability and conflict that began in the mid-90s has dramatically reduced national output and government revenue and increased external debt. With the installation of a transitional government in 2003 after peace accords, economic conditions slowly began to improve as the transitional government reopened relations with international financial institutions and international donors, and President KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress has been slow to reach the interior of the country although clear changes are evident in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. An uncertain legal framework, corruption, and a lack of transparency in government policy are long-term problems for the mining sector and for the economy as a whole. Much economic activity still occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, has boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth in recent years. The global recession cut economic growth in 2009 to less than half its 2008 level, but growth returned to around 7% per year in 2010-12. The DRC signed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF in 2009 and received $12 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief in 2010, but the IMF at the end of 2012 suspended the last three payments under the loan facility - worth $240 million - because of concerns about the lack of transparency in mining contracts. In 2012, the DRC updated its business laws by adhering to OHADA, the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa.

A quarter century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-Nguesso, and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest. Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March 2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a humanitarian crisis.

Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. Natural gas is increasingly being converted to electricity rather than being flared, greatly improving energy prospects. New mining projects, particularly iron ore, that entered production in late 2013 may add as much as $1 billion to annual government revenue. Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF, including recently concluded Article IV consultations. The current administration faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty. The drop in oil prices during the global crisis reduced oil revenue by about 30%, but the subsequent recovery of oil prices boosted the economy's GDP from 2009-13. Officially the country became a net external creditor as of 2011, with external debt representing only about 16% of GDP and debt servicing less than 3% of government revenue.;$20.26 billion (2013

15;Cote d'Ivoire;Close ties to France following independence in 1960, the development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment all made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African states but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history - overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002 that developed into a rebellion and then a civil war. The war ended in 2003 with a cease fire that left the country divided with the rebels holding the north, the government the south, and peacekeeping forces a buffer zone between the two. In March 2007, President GBAGBO and former New Forces rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed an agreement in which SORO joined GBAGBO's government as prime minister and the two agreed to reunite the country by dismantling the buffer zone, integrating rebel forces into the national armed forces, and holding elections. Difficulties in preparing electoral registers delayed balloting until 2010. In November 2010, Alassane Dramane OUATTARA won the presidential election over GBAGBO, but GBAGBO refused to hand over power, resulting in a five-month stand-off. In April 2011, after widespread fighting, GBAGBO was formally forced from office by armed OUATTARA supporters with the help of UN and French forces. Several thousand UN peacekeepers and several hundred French troops remain in Cote d'Ivoire to support the transition process. OUATTARA is focused on rebuilding the country's infrastructure and military after the five months of post-electoral fighting and faces ongoing threats from GBAGBO supporters, many of whom have sought shelter in Ghana. GBAGBO is in The Hague awaiting trial for crimes against humanity.;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Ghana and Liberia;8 00 N, 5 00 W;<a

Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil. Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for these products and in climatic conditions. Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top export revenue earners, but the country is also producing gold. The country also produces oil and boasted two offshore oil finds in 2012. Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political turmoil has continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss of foreign investment and slow economic growth. In June 2012, the IMF and the World Bank announced $4.4 billion in debt relief for Cote d'Ivoire under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

17;Egypt;The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's population through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure. Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster.

Egypt's economy was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo from 2004 to 2008 aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment and facilitate growth. Poor living conditions combined with limited job opportunities for the average Egyptian contribute to public discontent. After unrest erupted in January 2011, the Egyptian Government backtracked on economic reforms, drastically increasing social spending to address public dissatisfaction, but political uncertainty at the same time caused economic growth to slow significantly, reducing the government's revenues. Tourism, manufacturing, and construction were among the hardest hit sectors of the Egyptian economy, pushing up unemployment levels, and economic growth remains slow amid political uncertainty, government transitions, unrest, and cycles of violence. Cairo since 2011 has drawn down foreign exchange reserves and depended on foreign assistance, particularly from Gulf countries, to finance imports and energy products and prevent further devaluation of the Egyptian pound, fearing higher inflation from a weaker currency.;$551.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$541.5 billion (2012 est.)<br />$529.7 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$262 billion (2013 est.);1.8% (2013 est.)<br />2.2% (2012 est.)<br />1.8% (2011 est.);$6,600 (2013 est.)<br />$6,600 (2012 est.)<br />$6,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;12.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />13.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />13.8% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>78.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>11.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>14.3%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.4%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>18%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-23.2%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>14.5%<br /><i>industry: </i>37.5%<br /><i>services: </i>48% (2013 est.);cotton, rice, corn, wheat, beans, fruits, vegetables;textiles, food processing, tourism, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, hydrocarbons, construction, cement, metals, light manufactures;1.4% (2013 est.);27.69 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>29%<br /><i>industry: </i>24%<br /><i>services: </i>47% (2011 est.);13.4% (2013 est.)<br />12.7% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>4%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>26.6% (2008);22% (2008 est.);30.8 (2008)<br />32.1 (2005);<i>revenues: </i>$45.57 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$80.42 billion (2013 est.);17.4% of GDP (2013 est.);-13.3% of GDP (2013 est.);92.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />88% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data cover central government debt, and includes debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury;1 July -

18;Equatorial Guinea;Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a mainland portion plus five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest on the African continent. President Teodoro Obiang NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996, 2002, and 2009 presidential elections - as well as the 1999, 2004, 2008, and 2013 legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production, resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years, improvements in the population's living standards have been slow to develop.;;Central Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Cameroon and Gabon;2 00 N, 10 00 E;<a

The economy is still dominated by hydrocarbon production. The government has solicited foreign investment, particularly from the United States, to diversify the economy and in February 2014 the government hosted an economic diversification symposium focused on attracting investment in five sectors: agriculture and animal ranching, fishing, mining and petrochemicals, tourism, and financial services. Undeveloped mineral resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP. Subsistence farming is the dominant form of livelihood. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. The government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues and has attempted to address this issue by working towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.;$19.68 billion (2013 est.)<br />$19.97 billion (2012 est.)<br />$18.96 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$17.08 billion (2013

20;Ethiopia;Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. In 1974, a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea late in the 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission (EEBC) issued specific coordinates as virtually demarcating the border and pronounced its work finished. Alleging that the EEBC acted beyond its mandate in issuing the coordinates, Ethiopia has not accepted them and has not withdrawn troops from previously contested areas pronounced by the EEBC as belonging to Eritrea. In August 2012, longtime leader Prime Minister MELES Zenawi died in office and was replaced by his Deputy Prime Minister HAILEMARIAM Desalegn, marking the first peaceful transition of power in decades.;;Eastern Africa, west of Somalia;8 00 N, 38 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/africa.pdf">Africa</a>;<i>total: </i>1,104,300 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>1 million sq km<br /><i>water: </i>104,300 sq km;slightly less than twice the size of Texas;<i>total: </i>5,925 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Djibouti 342 km, Eritrea 1,033 km, Kenya 867 km, Somalia 1,640 km, South Sudan 1,299 km, Sudan 744 km;0 km (landlocked);none (landlocked);tropical monsoon with wide topographic-induced variation;high plateau with central mountain range divided by Great Rift Valley;<i>lowest point: </i>Danakil Depression -125 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Ras Dejen 4,533 m;small reserves of gold, platinum, copper, potash, natural gas, hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>13.19%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>1.01%<br /><i>other: </i>85.8% (2011);2,896 sq km (2003);122 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>5.56 cu km/yr (13%/1%/86%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>80.5 cu m/yr (2005);geologically active Great Rift Valley susceptible to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions;deforestation;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Environmental Modification, Law of the Sea;landlocked -

21;Gabon;El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world - dominated the country's political scene for four decades (1967-2009) following independence from France in 1960. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in December 2002 and the presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon. Following President BONGO's death in 2009, new elections brought Ali BONGO Ondimba, son of the former president, to power. Despite constrained political conditions, Gabon's small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make it one of the more stable African countries.;;Central

Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The economy was reliant on oil for about 50% of its GDP, about 70% of revenues, and 87% of goods exports for 2010, although some fields have passed their peak production. A rebound of oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth, but declining production has hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007, and later that year issued a $1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a sizable portion of its Paris Club debt. Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and manganese exports. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor fiscal management has stifled the economy. However, President BONGO ONDIMBA has made efforts to increase transparency and is taking steps to make Gabon a more attractive investment destination to diversify the economy. BONGO ONDIMBA has attempted to boost growth by increasing government investment in human resources and infrastructure. GDP grew more than 6% per year over the 2010-13 period.;$30.06 billion (2013 est.)<br />$28.19 billion (2012 est.)<br />$26.7 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$19.97 billion (2013 est.);6.6% (2013 est.)<br />5.6% (2012 est.)<br />7.1% (2011 est.);$19,200 (2013 est.)<br />$18,300 (2012 est.)<br />$17,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;44.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />47.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />44.9% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>39.1%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>10.5%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>33.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>58.1%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-41.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>3.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>63.9%<br /><i>services: </i>32.5% (2013 est.);cocoa, coffee, sugar, palm oil, rubber;petroleum extraction and refining;4.4% (2013 est.);629,100 (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>60%<br /><i>industry: </i>15%<br /><i>services: </i>25% (2000 est.);21% (2006 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.5%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>32.7% (2005);NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$5.031 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$6.599 billion (2013 est.);25.2% of GDP (2013 est.);-7.9% of GDP (2013 est.);23.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />22.2% of GDP (2012 est.);calendar year;1.2% (2013 est.)<br />2.7% (2012 est.);3% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />4.25% (31 December 2009 est.);15% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />15% (31 December 2012 est.);$2.497 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.552 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$3.973 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.908 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.7 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.672 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;$1.783 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.687 billion (2012 est.);$9.777 billion (2013 est.)<br />$10.2 billion (2012 est.);crude oil, timber, manganese, uranium;Japan 24.1%, US 17%, Australia 11.3%, India 7.4%, China 5.4%, Spain 4.1% (2012);$3.934 billion (2013 est.)<br />$3.638 billion (2012 est.);machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, chemicals, construction materials;France 28.2%, China 12.6%, US 9.4%, Belgium 5.8%, Cameroon 4.3% (2012);$2.47 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.373 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$3.433 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.196 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;;Cooperation Financiere en Afrique Centrale francs (XAF) per US dollar -<br />504.9 (2013 est.)<br />510.53 (2012 est.)<br />495.28 (2010 est.)<br />472.19 (2009)<br />447.81 (2008);;1.777 billion kWh (2010 est.);1.442 billion kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);415,000 kW (2010 est.);59% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);41% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);242,000 bbl/day (2012 est.);225,300 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);2 billion bbl (1 January 2013 est.);19,280 bbl/day (2010 est.);15,800 bbl/day (2011 est.);7,670 bbl/day (2010 est.);4,594 bbl/day (2010 est.);70 million cu m (2011 est.);80 million cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);28.32 billion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);4.758 million Mt (2011 est.);17,000 (2012);2.93 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>adequate system of cable, microwave radio relay, tropospheric scatter, radiotelephone communication stations, and a domestic satellite system with 12 earth stations<br /><i>domestic: </i>a growing mobile-cellular network with multiple providers is making telephone service more widely available with mobile-cellular teledensity exceeding 100 per 100 persons<br /><i>international: </i>country code -

22;Gambia, The;The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965. Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya JAMMEH led a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in 1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2011.;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and Senegal;13 28 N, 16 34 W;<a

relies in part on remittances from workers overseas and tourist receipts. About three-quarters of the population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood and the sector provides for about one-fifth of GDP. The agricultural sector has untapped potential - less than half of arable land is cultivated. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and upscale facilities. In 2012, however, sluggish tourism led to a decline in GDP. Tourism brings in about one-fifth of GDP. Agriculture also took a hit in 2012 due to unfavorable weather patterns. The Gambia's re-export trade accounts for almost 80% of goods exports. Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high. Economic progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on responsible government economic management, and on continued technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors.

23;Ghana;Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence. Ghana endured a long series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won presidential elections in 1992 and 1996 but was constitutionally prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS won the 2008 presidential election and took over as head of state, but he died in July 2012 and was constitutionally succeeded by his vice president John Dramani MAHAMA, who subsequently won the December 2012 presidential election.;;Western Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Cote d'Ivoire and Togo;8 00 N, 2 00 W;<a

In late 2010, Ghana was recategorized as a lower middle-income country. Ghana is well-endowed with natural resources and agriculture accounts for roughly one-quarter of GDP and employs more than half of the workforce, mainly small landholders. The services sector accounts for 50% of GDP. Gold and cocoa production and individual remittances are major sources of foreign exchange. Oil production at Ghana's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December 2010,and is producing close to target levels. Additional oil projects are being developed and are expected to come on line in a few years. Estimated oil reserves have jumped to almost 700 million barrels and Ghana’s growing oil industry is expected to boost economic growth as the country faces the consequences of two years of loose fiscal policy, high budget and current account deficits, and a depreciating currency. President MAHAMA faces challenges in managing a population that is unhappy with living standards and that perceives they are not reaping the benefits of oil production because of political

24;Guinea;Guinea is at a turning point after decades of authoritarian rule since gaining its independence from France in 1958. Guinea held its first free and competitive democratic presidential and legislative elections in 2010 and 2013 respectively. Alpha CONDE was elected to a five year term as president in 2010, and the National Assembly was seated in January 2014. CONDE's cabinet is the first all-civilian government in Guinea. Previously, Sekou TOURE ruled the country as president from independence to his death in 1984. Lansana CONTE came to power in 1984 when the military seized the government after TOURE's death. Gen. CONTE organized and won presidential elections in 1993, 1998, and 2003, though all the polls were rigged. Upon CONTE's death in December 2008, Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA led a military coup, seizing power and suspending the constitution. His unwillingness to yield to domestic and international pressure to step down led to heightened political tensions that culminated in September 2009 when presidential guards opened fire on an opposition rally killing more than 150 people, and in early December 2009 when CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and exiled to Burkina Faso. A transitional government led by Gen. Sekouba KONATE paved the way for Guinea's transition to a fledgling democracy.;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone;11 00 N, 10 00 W;<a

Guinea has historically been an exporter of agricultural commodities, but in recent years has shifted to importing the majority of food crops. Bauxite is Guinea’s main mineral resource as well as its main source of foreign currency. Guinea is the second largest producer of bauxite in the world and has the largest reserves of bauxite, estimated at 29 billion tons. The country also has significant iron ore, gold, and diamond reserves. However, Guinea has been unable to profit from this potential, as rampant corruption, dilapidated infrastructure, and political uncertainty have drained investor confidence. In the time since a 2008 coup following the death of long-term President Lansana CONTE, international donors, including the G-8, the IMF, and the World Bank, significantly curtailed their development programs but, following the December 2010 presidential elections, the IMF approved a new 3-year ECF arrangement in 2012. Guinea in September 2012 reached HIPC completion point status. Further international assistance and investment are contingent on the ability of the government to be transparent, combat corruption, reform its banking system, improve its business environment, and build infrastructure. International investors have expressed keen interest in Guinea's vast iron ore reserves, which could propel the country's growth. The government in April 2013 amended the September 2011 mining code to reduce taxes and royalties. Longer range plans to deploy broadband Internet throughout the country could spur economic growth as well. The biggest threats to Guinea’s economy are political instability and low international commodity prices.;$12.56 billion (2013 est.)<br />$12.21 billion (2012 est.)<br />$11.74 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$6.544 billion (2013 est.);2.9% (2013 est.)<br />3.9% (2012 est.)<br />3.9% (2011 est.);$1,100 (2013 est.)<br />$1,100 (2012 est.)<br />$1,100 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;NA% (2012 est.)<br />-6.4% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>84.7%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>12.4%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>37.1%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>22.8%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-57%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>22.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>46.5%<br /><i>services: </i>30.5% (2013 est.);rice, coffee, pineapples, palm kernels, cassava (manioc, tapioca), bananas, sweet potatoes;bauxite, gold, diamonds, iron ore;4.6% (2013 est.);5.409 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>76%<br /><i>industry and services: </i>24% (2006 est.);NA%;<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.7%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>30.3% (2007);47% (2006 est.);39.4 (2007)<br />40.3 (1994);<i>revenues: </i>$1.508 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.839 billion (2013 est.);23% of GDP (2013 est.);-5.1% of GDP (2013 est.);;calendar year;11.9% (2013 est.)<br />15.2% (2012 est.);NA% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />22.25% (31 December 2005);26% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />27% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.533 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.492 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.881 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.818 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.518 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.539 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$1.754 billion (2012 est.)<br />-$1.215 billion (2011 est.);$1.31 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.348 billion (2012 est.);bauxite, alumina, gold, diamonds, coffee, fish, agricultural products;India 10.6%, Spain 9.6%, Chile 9.4%, US 7.1%, Ireland 6.3%, Germany 6.3%, Ukraine 5.7%, France 5% (2012);$2.384 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.606 billion (2012 est.);petroleum products, metals, machinery, transport equipment, textiles, grain and other foodstuffs;China 14.2%, Netherlands 7.6% (2012);$183.1 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$174.3 million (31 December 2012 est.);$2.584 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$3.139 billion (31 December 2011 est.);;$145 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$145 million;Guinean francs (GNF) per US dollar -<br />6,875 (2013 est.)<br />6,986 (2012 est.)<br />5,726.1 (2010 est.)<br />5,500 (2009)<br />5,500 (2008);;969 million kWh (2010 est.);901.2 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);395,000 kW (2010 est.);68.4% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);31.6% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);8,671 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);9,089 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.419 million Mt (2011 est.);18,000 (2012);4.781 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>inadequate system of open-wire lines, small radiotelephone communication stations, and new microwave radio relay system<br /><i>domestic: </i>Conakry reasonably well-served;government maintains marginal control over broadcast media;.gn;15 (2012);95,000 (2009);;16 (2013);<i>total: </i>4<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>3 (2013);<i>total: </i>12<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>7<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>3<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>2 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>1,185 km<br /><i>standard gauge: </i>238 km 1.435-m gauge<br /><i>narrow gauge: </i>947 km 1.000-m gauge (2008);<i>total: </i>44,348 km<br /><i>paved: </i>4,342 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>40,006 km (2003);1,300 km (navigable by shallow-draft native craft in the northern part of the Niger system) (2011);;<i>major seaport(s): </i>Conakry, Kamsar;;National Armed Forces: Army, Guinean Navy (Armee de Mer or Marine Guineenne, includes Marines), Guinean Air Force (Force Aerienne de Guinee) (2009);18-25 years of age for compulsory and voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>2,359,203<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>2,329,784 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,493,991<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,535,418 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>118,443<br /><i>female: </i>115,901 (2010 est.);;;conflicts among rebel groups, warlords, and youth gangs in neighboring states have spilled over into Guinea resulting in domestic instability;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>6,493 (Cote d'Ivoire) (2013);<i>current situation: </i>Guinea is a source, transit, and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;
25;Guinea-Bissau;Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in office, YALA was overthrown in a bloodless military coup, and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea and

26;Kenya;Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when President Daniel MOI took power in a constitutional succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over a constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people died. African Union-sponsored mediation led by former UN Secretary General Kofi ANNAN in late February 2008 resulted in a power-sharing accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister. The power sharing accord included a broad reform agenda, the centerpiece of which was constitutional reform. In August 2010, Kenyans overwhelmingly adopted a new constitution in a national referendum. The new constitution introduced additional checks and balances to executive power and significant devolution of power and resources to 47 newly created counties. It also eliminated the position of prime minister following the first presidential election under the new constitution, which occurred on 4 March 2013. Uhuru KENYATTA, the son of founding president Jomo KENYATTA, won the March elections in the first round by a close margin and was sworn into office on 9 April 2013.;;Eastern Africa, bordering the

27;Lesotho;Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled the country during its first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King LETSIE III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Batswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In May 2012, competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas THABANE form a coalition government - the first in the country's history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent, Pakalitha MOSISILI, who peacefully transferred power the following month.;;Southern Africa, an enclave of South Africa;29 30 S, 28 30 E;<a

Civil war and government mismanagement destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around the capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the conclusion of fighting and the installation of a democratically elected government in 2006, several have returned. Liberia is richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, and iron ore and rubber have driven growth in recent years. Liberia is also reviving its raw timber sector and is encouraging oil exploration. President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-educated banker and administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support from international donors, and encourage private investment. Rebuilding infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on financial and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation. The country achieved high growth during 2010-13 due to favorable world prices for its commodities. In the future, growth will depend on global commodity prices, on sustained foreign aid, trade, investment, and remittances, on the development of infrastructure and institutions, but mostly on maintaining political stability and security.;$2.898 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.681 billion (2012 est.)<br />$2.475 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$1.977

Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar al-QADHAFI assumed leadership and began to espouse his political system at home, which was a combination of socialism and Islam. During the 1970s, QADHAFI used oil revenues to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting subversive and terrorist activities that included the downing of two airliners - one over Scotland, another in Northern Africa - and a discotheque bombing in Berlin.

Substantial revenue from the energy sector coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in Africa, but Tripoli largely has not used its significant financial resources to develop national infrastructure or the economy, leaving many citizens poor. In the final five years of QADHAFI's rule, Libya made some progress on economic reform as part of a broader campaign to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and after Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs to build weapons of mass destruction.

30;Madagascar;Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. During 1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the winner. RAVALOMANANA achieved a second term following a landslide victory in the generally free and fair presidential elections of 2006. In early 2009, protests over increasing restrictions on opposition press and activities resulted in RAVALOMANANA handing over power to the military, which then conferred the presidency on the mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA, in what amounted to a coup d'etat. Following a lengthy mediation process led by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Madagascar held UN-supported presidential and parliamentary elections in 2013. Former de facto finance minister Hery RAJAONARIMAMPIANINA defeated RAVALOMANANA's favored candidate Jean-Louis ROBINSON in a presidential runoff and was inaugurated in January 2014. Most international observers, while noting some irregularities, declared polls to be a credible reflection of the Malagasy public's will.;;Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of

policy of privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the political crisis. This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80% of the population.

31;Malawi;Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland became the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country held multiparty elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution that came into full effect the following year. President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2005. MUTHARIKA was reelected to a second term in May 2009. He oversaw some economic improvement in his first term, but was accused of economic mismanagement and poor governance in his second term. He died abruptly in April 2012 and was succeeded by his vice president, Joyce BANDA, who had earlier started her own party, the People's Party (PP). Population growth, increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the scourge of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi.;;Southern Africa, east of Zambia, west and north of Mozambique;13

The economy is predominately agricultural with about 80% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture, which has benefited from fertilizer subsidies since 2006, accounts for one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In December 2007, the US granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support within the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. The government faces many challenges including developing a market economy, improving educational facilities, facing up to environmental problems, dealing with the rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened. Between 2005 and 2009 President BANDA'S government exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) worth $56 million. The government announced infrastructure projects that could yield improvements, such as a new oil pipeline for better fuel access, and the potential for a waterway link through Mozambican rivers to the ocean for better transportation options. Since 2009, however, Malawi has experienced some setbacks, including a general shortage of foreign exchange, which has damaged its ability to pay for imports, and fuel shortages that hinder transportation and productivity. Investment has fallen continuously for several years and in 2013 amounted to just 13% of GDP. The government has failed to address barriers to investment such as unreliable power, water shortages, poor telecommunications infrastructure, and the high costs of services.

32;Mali;The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup that ushered in a period of democratic rule. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first two democratic presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. In keeping with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, he stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou Toumani TOURE, who was elected to a second term in 2007 elections that were widely judged to be free and fair. Malian returnees from Libya in 2011 exacerbated tensions in northern Mali, and Tuareg ethnic militias started a rebellion in January 2012. Low- and mid-level soldiers, frustrated with the poor handling of the rebellion overthrew TOURE on 22 March. Intensive mediation efforts led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) returned power to a civilian administration in April with the appointment of interim President Dioncounda TRAORE. The post-coup chaos led to rebels expelling the Malian military from the three northern regions of the country and allowed Islamic militants to set up strongholds. Hundreds of thousands of northern Malians fled the violence to southern Mali and neighboring countries, exacerbating regional food insecurity in host communities. An international military intervention to retake the three northern regions began in January 2013 and within a month most of the north had been retaken. In a democratic presidential election conducted in July and August of 2013, Ibrahim Boubacar KEITA was elected president in the second round.;;interior Western Africa, southwest of Algeria, north of

33;Mauritania;Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule. Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and installed a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected president in July 2009 and sworn in the following month. AZIZ sustained injuries from an accidental shooting by his own troops in October 2012 but has continued to maintain his authority. The country continues to experience ethnic tensions among its black population (Afro-Mauritanians) and white and black Moor (Arab-Berber) communities, and confronts a terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Senegal and Western Sahara;20 00 N, 12 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/africa.pdf">Africa</a>;<i>total: </i>1,030,700 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>1,030,700 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km;slightly larger than three times the size of New Mexico;<i>total: </i>5,074 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Algeria 463 km, Mali 2,237 km, Senegal 813 km, Western Sahara 1,561 km;754 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin;desert;mostly barren, flat plains of the Sahara;<i>lowest point: </i>Sebkhet Te-n-Dghamcha -5 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Kediet Ijill 915 m;iron ore, gypsum, copper, phosphate, diamonds, gold, oil, fish;<i>arable land: </i>0.44%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.01%<br /><i>other: </i>99.55% (2011);450.1 sq km (2004);11.4 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>1.35 cu km/yr (7%/2%/91%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>420.2 cu m/yr (2005);hot, dry, dust/sand-laden sirocco wind blows primarily in March and April;overgrazing, deforestation, and soil erosion aggravated by drought are contributing to desertification;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;most of the population is concentrated in the cities of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou and along the Senegal River in the southern part of the country;<i>noun: </i>Mauritanian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Mauritanian;black Moors (Haratines -

Half the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though many of the nomads and subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania's extensive mineral resources include iron ore, gold, copper, gypsum, and phosphate rock and exploration is ongoing for uranium, crude oil, and natural gas. Extractive commodities make up 75% of Mauritania's total exports.

34;Mauritius;Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century. The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita incomes.;;Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, about 800 km (500 mi) east of Madagascar;20 17 S, 57 33 E;<a

Mauritius has achieved steady and strong growth over the last several decades, resulting in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-13, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe.;$20.95 billion (2013 est.)<br />$20.26 billion (2012 est.)<br />$19.61 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$11.9 billion (2013 est.);3.4% (2013 est.)<br />3.3% (2012 est.)<br />3.8% (2011 est.);$16,100 (2013 est.)<br />$15,600 (2012 est.)<br />$15,200 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;32% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />32% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />31% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>74.1%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>13.2%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>22%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>1.5%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>54.6%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-65.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>4.5%<br /><i>industry: </i>22%<br /><i>services: </i>73.4% (2013 est.);sugarcane, tea, corn, potatoes, bananas, pulses;food processing (largely sugar milling), textiles, clothing, mining, chemicals, metal products, transport equipment, nonelectrical machinery, tourism;0.2% (2013 est.);637,600 (2013 est.);<i>agriculture and fishing: </i>9%<br /><i>construction and industry: </i>30%<br /><i>transportation and communication: </i>7%<br /><i>trade, restaurants, hotels: </i>22%<br /><i>finance: </i>6%<br /><i>other services: </i>25% (2007);8.3% (2013 est.)<br />8.1% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;8% (2006 est.);39 (2006 est.)<br />37 (1987 est.);<i>revenues: </i>$2.507 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.736 billion (2013 est.);21.1% of GDP (2013 est.);-1.9% of GDP (2013 est.);58% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />57.7% of GDP (2012 est.);1 July - 30 June;3.5% (2013 est.)<br />3.9% (2012 est.);9% (31 December 2010 est.);NA% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />8.67% (31 December 2012 est.);$2.475 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.378 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$11.73 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$11.38 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$13.03 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$12.87 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$7.667 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$7.442 billion (31 December 2010 est.);-$1.099 billion (2013 est.)<br />-$1.175 billion (2012 est.);$2.788 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.673 billion (2012 est.);clothing and textiles, sugar, cut flowers, molasses, fish, primates (for research);UK 19.3%, France 16.4%, US 9.9%, South Africa 9.8%, Spain 7.5%, Italy 6.9%, Madagascar 6.8% (2012);$4.953 billion (2013 est.)<br />$5.104 billion (2012 est.);manufactured goods, capital equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals;India 23.1%, China 16%, France 8.5%, South Africa 6.5% (2012);$3.286 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.046 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.894 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.606 billion (31 December 2012 est.);NA;NA;Mauritian rupees (MUR) per US dollar -<br />30.89 (2013 est.)<br />30.051 (2012 est.)<br />30.784 (2010 est.)<br />31.96 (2009)<br />27.973 (2008);;2.628 billion kWh (2011 est.);2.358 billion kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);900,200 kW (2010 est.);75.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);6.6% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);17.8% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);24,710 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);20,620 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);5.06 million Mt (2011 est.);349,100 (2012);1.485 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>small system with good service<br /><i>domestic: </i>monopoly over fixed-line services terminated in 2005;the government maintains control over TV broadcasting through the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), which operates 3 analog and 10 digital TV stations;.mu;51,139 (2012);290,000 (2009);;5 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);;;;<i>total: </i>2,149 km<br /><i>paved: </i>2,149 km (includes 75 km of expressways) (2012);;<i>total: </i>4<br /><i>by type: </i>passenger/cargo 2, petroleum tanker 1, refrigerated cargo 1 (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Port Louis;;no regular military forces;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>343,628 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>280,596<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>283,317 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>10,193<br /><i>female: </i>10,104 (2010 est.);0.19% of GDP (2012)<br />0.16% of GDP (2011)<br />0.19% of GDP (2010);;Mauritius and Seychelles claim the Chagos Islands;;;consumer and transshipment point for heroin from South Asia

In the 1980s Morocco was a heavily indebted country before pursuing austerity measures and pro-market reforms, overseen by the IMF. Since taking the throne in 1999, King MOHAMMED VI has presided over a stable economy marked by steady growth, low inflation, and gradually falling unemployment, although a poor harvest and economic difficulties in Europe contributed to an economic slowdown in 2012. Industrial development strategies and infrastructure improvements - most visibly illustrated by a new port and free trade zone near Tangier - are improving Morocco's competitiveness. Morocco also seeks to expand its renewable energy capacity with a goal of making renewable 40% of electricity output by 2020. Key sectors of the economy include agriculture, tourism, phosphates, textiles, apparel, and subcomponents. To boost exports, Morocco entered into a bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 2006 and an Advanced Status agreement with the European Union in 2008. Despite Morocco's economic progress, the country suffers from high unemployment, poverty, and illiteracy, particularly in rural areas. In 2011 and 2012, high prices on fuel - which is subsidized and almost entirely imported - strained the government's budget and widened the country's current account deficit. In the fall of 2013, Morocco capped some of its fuel subsidies in an effort to gradually reduce the country’s large budgetary deficit. Key economic challenges for Morocco include fighting corruption and reforming the education system, the judiciary, and the government's costly subsidy program.;$180 billion (2013 est.)<br />$171.2

36;Mozambique;Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid 1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between Frelimo and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment. President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in October 2009. However, the elections were flawed by voter fraud, questionable disqualification of candidates, and Frelimo use of government resources during the campaign. As a result, Freedom House removed Mozambique from its list of electoral democracies.;;Southeastern Africa, bordering the Mozambique Channel, between South Africa and Tanzania;18 15 S, 35 00 E;<a

Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth rate. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique remained dependent upon foreign assistance for 40% of its 2012 annual budget and over half the population remained below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force and smallholder agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak. A substantial trade imbalance persists although aluminum production from the Mozal smelter has significantly boosted export earnings in recent years. In 2012, The Mozambican government took over Portugal's last remaining share in the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity Company (HCB), a signficant contributor to the Southern African Power Pool. The government has plans to expand the Cahora Bassa Dam and build additional dams to increase its electricity exports and fulfill the needs of its burgeoning domestic industries. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is now at a manageable level. In July 2007, the US government's Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a $506.9 million Compact with Mozambique. Compact projects will end in September 2013 and are focusing on improving sanitation, roads, agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country. Citizens rioted in September 2010, after fuel, water, electricity, and bread price increases were announced. In an attempt to lessen the negative impact on people, the government implemented subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal measures. Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 6%-8% in the decade up to 2013, one of Africa's strongest performances. Mozambique's ability to attract large investment projects in natural resources is expected to fuel continued high growth in coming years. Revenues from these vast resources, including natural gas, coal, titanium and hydroelectric capacity, could overtake donor assistance within five years.;$28.15 billion (2013 est.)<br />$26.31 billion

Mining accounts for 11.5% of GDP, but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Marine diamond mining is becoming increasingly important as the terrestrial diamond supply has dwindled. Namibia is the world's fourth-largest producer of uranium. It also produces large quantities of zinc and is a small producer of gold and other minerals. The mining and quarrying sectors employs only about 1.8% of the population. Namibia normally imports about 50% of its cereal requirements;$17.79 billion (2013 est.)<br />$17.05 billion (2012 est.)<br />$16.23 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$12.3 billion (2013 est.);4.4% (2013 est.)<br />5% (2012 est.)<br />5.7% (2011 est.);$8,200 (2013 est.)<br />$7,900 (2012 est.)<br />$7,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;NA% (2013 est.)<br />30.4% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />27% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>59.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>26.2%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>22.8%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.5%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>41.4%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-50.9%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>7.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>29.6%<br /><i>services: </i>62.6% (2013 est.);millet, sorghum, peanuts, grapes;meatpacking, fish processing, dairy products, pasta, beverages;5.6% (2013 est.);880,400 (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>16.3%<br /><i>industry: </i>22.4%<br /><i>services: </i>61.3%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>about half of Namibia's people are unemployed while about two-thirds live in rural areas;27.4% (2012 est.)<br />51.2% (2008 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.4%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>42% (2010);28.7%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>the UNDP's 2005 Human Development Report indicated that 34.9% of the population live on $1 per day and 55.8% live on $2 per day (2010 est.);59.7 (2010)<br />70.7 (2003);<i>revenues: </i>$4.325 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$5.126 billion (2013 est.);35.2% of GDP (2013 est.);-6.5% of GDP (2013 est.);27.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />25.8% of GDP (2012 est.);1 April - 31 March;5.5% (2013 est.)<br />6.5% (2012 est.);5.5% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />12% (31 December 2010 est.);9.25% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />8.7% (31 December 2012 est.);$2.723 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.941 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$7.22 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$7.228 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$5.942 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$6.266 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.305 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$1.152 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$1.176 billion (31 December 2010 est.);-$658.4 million (2013 est.)<br />-$414 million (2012 est.);$5.124 billion (2013 est.)<br />$4.883 billion (2012 est.);diamonds, copper, gold, zinc, lead, uranium;;$7.084 billion (2013 est.)<br />$6.44 billion (2012 est.);foodstuffs;;$2.267 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.738 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$4.312 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$4.292 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;$NA;Namibian dollars (NAD) per US dollar -<br />9.282 (2013 est.)<br />8.2031 (2012 est.)<br />7.3212 (2010 est.)<br />8.42 (2009)<br />7.75 (2008);;1.331 billion kWh (2013 est.);4.238 billion kWh (2013 est.);89 million kWh (2013 est.);2.907 billion kWh (2013 est.);487,000 kW (2013 est.);31.8% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);68.2% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);22,990 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);20,810 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 cu m (2012 est.);0 cu m (2012 est.);0 cu m (2012 est.);0 cu m (2012 est.);62.29 billion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);3.217 million Mt (2011 est.);171,000 (2012);2.435 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>good system;1 private and 1 state-run TV station;.na;78,280 (2012);127,500 (2009);;112 (2013);<i>total: </i>19<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>4<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>2<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>12<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>93<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>25<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>52<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>16 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>2,626 km<br /><i>narrow gauge: </i>2,626 km 1.067-m gauge (2008);<i>total: </i>44,138 km<br /><i>paved: </i>6,387 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>37,751 km (2010);;<i>total: </i>1<br /><i>by type: </i>cargo 1 (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Luderitz, Walvis Bay;;Namibian Defense Force (NDF): Army, Navy, Air Force (2013);18 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>568,231 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>351,431<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>311,513 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>26,413<br /><i>female: </i>26,038 (2010 est.);3.11% of GDP (2012)<br />3.38% of GDP (2011)<br />3.11% of GDP (2010);;concerns from international experts and local populations over the Okavango Delta ecology in Botswana and human displacement scuttled Namibian plans to construct a hydroelectric dam on Popa Falls along the Angola-Namibia border;;<i>current situation: </i>Namibia is predominantly a country of origin and destination for children and, to a lesser extent, women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;
38;Niger;Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA, immediately suspended the constitution, and dissolved the Cabinet. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou emerged victorious from a crowded field in the election following the coup and was inaugurated in April 2011. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. The Nigerien Movement for Justice, a predominantly ethnic Tuareg rebel group, emerged in February 2007, and attacked several military targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008. Successful government offensives in 2009 ended the rebellion. Niger is facing increased security concerns on its borders from various external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the conflict in Mali, and violent extremism in northeastern

economy centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Agriculture contributes about one-third of GDP and provides livelihood for about nine-tenths of the population. Drought, desertification, and strong population growth have undercut the economy. Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union. Debt relief has significantly reduced Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. The economy in recent years has been hurt by terrorist activity and kidnappings near its uranium mines and instability in Mali. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Niger has sizable reserves of oil and oil production, which began in 2012, along with refining, and exports are expected to grow through 2016. However, oil revenues have fallen well short of predictions, mainly because of logistical challenges. Food insecurity and drought remain perennial problems for Niger. The mining sector may be affected by the government’s attempt to renegotiate extraction rights contracts.;$13.98 billion (2013 est.)<br />$13.17 billion (2012 est.)<br />$11.84 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$7.304 billion (2013 est.);6.2% (2013 est.)<br />11.2% (2012 est.)<br />2.2% (2011 est.);$800 (2013 est.)<br />$800 (2012 est.)<br />$800 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;23.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />22% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />25.3% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>61%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>25.1%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>44.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>26.3%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-57.1%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>35.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>14.2%<br /><i>services: </i>50.6% (2013 est.);cowpeas, cotton, peanuts, millet, sorghum, cassava (manioc, tapioca), rice;uranium mining, petroleum, cement, brick, soap, textiles, food processing, chemicals, slaughterhouses;5.7% (2013 est.);4.688 million (2007);<i>agriculture: </i>90%<br /><i>industry: </i>6%<br /><i>services: </i>4% (1995);NA%;<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.7%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>28.5% (2007);63% (1993 est.);34 (2007)<br />50.5 (1995);<i>revenues: </i>$1.911 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.086 billion (2013 est.);26.2% of GDP (2013 est.);-2.4% of GDP (2013 est.);;calendar year;1.9% (2013 est.)<br />0.5% (2012 est.);4.25% (31 December 2009)<br />4.75% (31 December 2008);4% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />4% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.388 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.284 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.74 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.61 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$992.7 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$915 million (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$1.45 billion (2013 est.)<br />-$1.453 billion (2012 est.);$1.539 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.458 billion (2012 est.);uranium ore, livestock, cowpeas, onions;Nigeria 40.3%, US 17.2%, India 14.3%, Italy 8.6%, China 7.8%, Ghana 5.3% (2012);$2.314 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.273 billion (2012 est.);foodstuffs, machinery, vehicles and parts, petroleum, cereals;France 14.4%, China 11.3%, Nigeria 10.1%, French Polynesia 9.2%, Togo 5.1%, Cote dIvoire 4.5% (2012);;$1.556 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.551 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;;Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -<br />500.7 (2013 est.)<br />510.53 (2012 est.)<br />495.28 (2010)<br />472.19 (2009)<br />447.81 (2008);;250 million kWh (2010 est.);832.5 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);600 million kWh (2010 est.);134,000 kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);20,000 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);NA bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);5,629 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);5,136 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.272 million Mt (2011 est.);100,500 (2012);5.4 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>inadequate;state-run TV station;.ne;454 (2012);115,900 (2009);;30 (2013);<i>total: </i>10<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>3<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>6<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>20<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>3<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>15<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>2 (2013);1 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>18,949 km<br /><i>paved: </i>3,912 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>15,037 km (2010);300 km (the Niger, the only major river, is navigable to Gaya between September and March) (2012);;;;Nigerien Armed Forces (Forces Armees Nigeriennes, FAN): Army, Nigerien Air Force (Force Aerienne du Niger) (2012);18 is the presumed legal minimum age for compulsory or voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>3,329,184<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>3,267,669 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>2,194,570<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>2,219,416 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>186,348<br /><i>female: </i>180,779 (2010 est.);1.06% of GDP (2012)<br />NA% (2011)<br />1.06% of GDP (2010);;Libya claims about 25,000 sq km in a currently dormant dispute in the Tommo region;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>49,770 (Mali) (2013);;

40;Rwanda;In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions, culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide, in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens, including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population. The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF, operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda, defeated the national army and Hutu militias, and established an RPF-led government of national unity. Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and former Zaire. Since then, most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF did in 1990. Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there, and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009. In January 2013, Rwanda assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2013-14 term.;;Central Africa, east of Democratic Republic of the Congo;2 00 S, 30 00 E;<a

Tourism, minerals, coffee and tea are Rwanda's main sources of foreign exchange. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the country's ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded with an average annual growth of 7%-8% since 2003 and inflation has been reduced to single digits. Nonetheless, a significant percent of the population still live below the official poverty line. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Rwanda continues to receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06. In recognition of Rwanda's successful management of its macro economy, in 2010, the IMF graduated Rwanda to a Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Rwanda also received a Millennium Challenge Threshold Program in 2008. Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional trade. Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners. The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms. Energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap private sector growth. The Rwandan Government is seeking to become regional leader in information and communication technologies. In 2010, Rwanda neared completion of the first modern Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Kigali. The SEZ seeks to attract investment in all sectors, but specifically in agribusiness, information and communications technologies, trade and logistics, mining, and construction. The global downturn hurt export demand and tourism, but economic growth has recovered, driven in large part by the services sector, but inflation has grown. On the back of this growth, government is gradually ending its fiscal stimulus policy while protecting aid to the poor.;$16.37 billion (2013 est.)<br />$15.23 billion (2012 est.)<br />$14.1 billion

41;Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha;Saint Helena is a British Overseas Territory consisting of Saint Helena and Ascension Islands, and the island group of Tristan da Cunha.<br /><i>Saint Helena: </i>Uninhabited when first discovered by the Portuguese in 1502, Saint Helena was garrisoned by the British during the 17th century. It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile from 1815 until his death in 1821, but its importance as a port of call declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, several thousand Boer prisoners were confined on the island between 1900 and 1903.<br /><i>Ascension Island: </i>This barren and uninhabited island was discovered and named by the Portuguese in 1503. The British garrisoned the island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena. It served as a provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty control until 1922, when it became a dependency of Saint Helena. During World War II, the UK permitted the US to construct an airfield on Ascension in support of transatlantic flights to Africa and anti-submarine operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s the island became an important space tracking station for the US. In 1982, Ascension was an essential staging area for British forces during the Falklands War. It remains a critical refueling point in the air-bridge from the UK to the South Atlantic.<br /><i>Tristan da Cunha: </i>The island group consists of the islands of Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough.

While independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s. The country held its first free elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling between the various political parties precipitated repeated changes in leadership and two failed coup attempts in 1995 and 2003. In 2012, three opposition parties combined in a no confidence vote to bring down the majority government of former Prime Minister Patrice TROVOADA.

and a red isosceles triangle based on the hoist side;;<i>name: </i>&quot;;This small, poor island economy has become increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence in 1975. Cocoa production has substantially declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome and Principe has to import fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial amount of food, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. Over the years, it has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, which helped bring down the country's $300 million debt burden. In August 2005, the government signed on to a new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program worth $4.3 million. In April 2011 the country completed a Threshold Country Program with The Millennium Challenge Corporation to help increase tax revenues, reform customs, and improve the business environment. Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. Potential exists for the development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual production is at least several years off. The first production licenses were sold in 2004, though a dispute over licensing with Nigeria delayed the country's receipt of more than $20 million in signing bonuses for almost a year. Maintaining control of inflation, fiscal discipline, and increasing flows of foreign direct investment into the oil sector are the major economic problems facing the country.;$421 million (2013 est.)<br />$402.4 million (2012 est.)<br />$387.8 million (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$311 million (2013 est.);4.5% (2013 est.)<br />4% (2012 est.)<br />4.9% (2011 est.);$2,200 (2013 est.)<br />$2,200 (2012 est.)<br />$2,300 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;32.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />27.4% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />16.8% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>137.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>12%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>53.1%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>-1.4%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>13.2%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-114.5%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>13.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>19.5%<br /><i>services: </i>66.8% (2013 est.);cocoa, coconuts, palm kernels, copra, cinnamon, pepper, coffee, bananas, papayas, beans;light construction, textiles, soap, beer, fish processing, timber;4% (2013 est.);52,490 (2007);<i><b>note:</b> </i>population mainly engaged in subsistence agriculture and fishing;NA%;<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;66.2% (2009 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$83.94 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$120.3 million (2013 est.);27% of GDP (2013 est.);-11.7% of GDP (2013 est.);65.5% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />75.5% of GDP (2012 est.);calendar year;8.7% (2013 est.)<br />10.6% (2012 est.);16% (31 December 2009)<br />28% (31 December 2008);26% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />26% (31 December 2012 est.);$47.43 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$38.63 million (31 December 2012 est.);$109.9 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$99.74 million (31 December 2012 est.);$97.37 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$94.99 million (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$59 million (2013 est.)<br />-$58.7 million (2012 est.);$12.1 million (2013 est.)<br />$12.2 million (2012 est.);cocoa 80%, copra, coffee, palm oil;Netherlands 33.3%, Belgium 21.8%, Spain 11%, Nigeria 5.6%, US 5.1% (2012);$112.8 million (2013 est.)<br />$115.1 million (2012 est.);machinery and electrical equipment, food products, petroleum products;Portugal 63.1%, Gabon 5.4% (2012);$46.6 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$51.59 million (31 December 2012 est.);$406.8 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$313.3 million (31 December 2012 est.);;;dobras (STD) per US dollar -<br />18,702 (2013 est.)<br />19,068 (2012 est.)<br />18,499 (2010 est.)<br />16,209 (2009)<br />14,900 (2008);;30 million kWh (2010 est.);27.9 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012);0 kWh (2012 est.);14,000 kW (2010 est.);57.1% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);42.9% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);904 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);889 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);151,600 Mt (2011 est.);8,000 (2012);122,000 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>local telephone network of adequate quality with most lines connected to digital switches<br /><i>domestic: </i>combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 65 telephones per 100 persons<br /><i>international: </i>country code - 239;1 government-owned TV station;.st;1,678 (2012);26,700 (2009);;2 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);;;;;<i>total: </i>320 km<br /><i>paved: </i>218 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>102 km (2000);;<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>by type: </i>bulk carrier 1, cargo 2<br /><i>foreign-owned: </i>2 (China 1, Greece 1) (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Sao Tome;;Armed Forces of Sao Tome and Principe (Forcas Armadas de Sao Tome e Principe, FASTP): Army, Coast Guard of Sao Tome e Principe (Guarda Costeira de Sao Tome e Principe, GCSTP);18 is the legal minimum age for compulsory military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>39,182<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>39,845 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>27,310<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>29,279 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>2,076<br /><i>female: </i>2,003 (2010 est.);;Sao Tome and Principe's army is a tiny force with almost no resources at its disposal and would be wholly ineffective operating unilaterally;none;;;
43;Senegal;The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960. The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict. Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa and has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until Abdoulaye WADE was elected president in 2000. He was reelected in 2007 and during his two terms amended Senegal's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the opposition. His decision to run for a third presidential term sparked a large public backlash that led to his defeat in a March 2012 runoff election with Macky SALL.;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic

The country's key export industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production, and commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and oil exploration projects. senegal relies heavily on donor assistance and foreign direct investment. President Macky SALL, who was elected in March 2012 under a reformist policy agenda, inherited an economy with a weak infrastructure, challenging business environment, and a culture of overspending that still plagued the country in 2013. The IMF completed a non-dispersing, Policy Support Initiative program in December 2010 and approved a new three-year policy support instrument to assist with economic reforms. The economy continues to suffer from unreliable power supplies and rising costs of living, which has led to public protests and high unemployment and has prompted migrants to flee Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe.;$27.72 billion (2013 est.)<br />$26.65 billion (2012 est.)<br />$25.74 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$15.36 billion (2013

pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the upper-middle-income group of countries. Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. In 2008, having depleted its foreign exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest payments due on a $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and immediately enacted a number of significant structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate, reform of the public sector to include layoffs, and the selling of some state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that Seychelles had successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full employment and a fiscal surplus.;$2.404 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.326 billion (2012 est.)<br />$2.261 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$1.271 billion (2013 est.);3.3% (2013 est.)<br />2.9% (2012 est.)<br />5% (2011 est.);$25,900 (2013 est.)<br />$25,300 (2012 est.)<br />$24,900 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;18.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />10.6% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />6.3% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>92.3%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>11.9%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>28.2%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>15.2%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>35.1%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-82.7%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>2%<br /><i>industry: </i>18.7%<br /><i>services: </i>79.4% (2013 est.);coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet potatoes, cassava (manioc, tapioca), copra, bananas;fishing, tourism, processing of coconuts and vanilla, coir (coconut fiber) rope, boat building, printing, furniture;3.7% (2013 est.);39,560 (2006);<i>agriculture: </i>3%<br /><i>industry: </i>23%<br /><i>services: </i>74% (2006);2% (2006 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>4.7%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>15.4% (2007);NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$516.7 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$491.7 million (2013 est.);40.7% of GDP (2013 est.);2% of GDP (2013 est.);51.8% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />68.4% of GDP (2012 est.);calendar year;4.3% (2013 est.)<br />7.1% (2012 est.);11.17% (31 December 2010 est.);12.4% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />12.19% (31 December 2012 est.);$380.7 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$301.5 million (31 December 2012 est.);$584.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$383.1 million (31 December 2012 est.);$617.6 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$408.1 million (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$140 million (2013 est.)<br />-$208.9 million (2012 est.);$516.7 million (2013 est.)<br />$493.3 million (2012 est.);canned tuna, frozen fish, cinnamon bark, copra, petroleum products (reexports);France 27.7%, UK 17.6%, Japan 15.2%, Italy 10.6% (2012);$846.4 million (2013 est.)<br />$889.6 million (2012 est.);machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals, other manufactured goods;Saudi Arabia 24%, Spain 12.1%, France 5.9% (2012);$362.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$318.7 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.719 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.733 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;;Seychelles rupees (SCR) per US dollar -<br />12 (2013 est.)<br />13.704 (2012 est.)<br />12.068 (2010 est.)<br />13.61 (2009)<br />8 (2008);;283 million kWh (2010 est.);263.2 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);89,000 kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);7,793 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);6,316 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.088 million Mt (2011 est.);28,900 (2012);138,300 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>effective system<br /><i>domestic: </i>combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 170 telephones per 100 persons;the government operates the only terrestrial TV station, which provides local programming and airs broadcasts from international services;.sc;247 (2012);32,000 (2008);;14 (2013);<i>total: </i>7<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>5<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>7<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>5 (2013);1 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>508 km<br /><i>paved: </i>490 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>18 km (2010);;<i>total: </i>9<br /><i>by type: </i>cargo 1, carrier 1, chemical tanker 6, petroleum tanker 1<br /><i>foreign-owned: </i>3 (Hong Kong 1, Nigeria 1, South Africa 1) (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Victoria;;Seychelles Defense Force: Army, Coast Guard (includes Naval Wing, Air Wing), National Guard (2005);18 years of age for voluntary military service (younger with parental consent);<i>males age 16-49: </i>26,257<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>23,996 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>20,231<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>19,891 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>686<br /><i>female: </i>650 (2010 est.);0.89% of GDP (2012)<br />0.82% of GDP (2011)<br />0.89% of GDP (2010);;Mauritius and Seychelles claim the Chagos Islands (UK-administered British Indian Ocean Territory);;<i>current situation: </i>Seychelles is a source and destination country for Seychellois children and foreign women subjected to sex trafficking;
45;Sierra Leone;Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil war from 1991 to 2002 that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about a third of the population). The military, which took over full responsibility for security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of 2005, is increasingly developing as a guarantor of the country's stability. The armed forces remained on the sideline during the 2007 and 2012 national elections, and over the past year have deployed over 850 peacekeepers in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). As of January 2014, Sierra Leone also fielded 122 staff for five UN peacekeeping missions. In March 2014, the closure of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) marked the end of more than 15 years of peacekeeping and political operations in Sierra Leone. The government's priorities include furthering development, creating jobs, and stamping out endemic corruption.;;Western Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Guinea and Liberia;8 30 N,

46;Somalia;Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow its protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new nation of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing, and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence;;Eastern Africa,

areas of the country, including the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in northwestern Somalia and the semi-autonomous state of Puntland in northeastern Somalia;Despite the lack of effective national governance, Somalia maintains an informal economy largely based on livestock, remittance/money transfer companies, and telecommunications. Agriculture is the most important sector with livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and more than 50% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food to electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Somalia's government lacks the ability to collect domestic revenue, and arrears to the IMF have continued to grow. Somalia's capital city - Mogadishu - has witnessed the development of the city's first gas stations, supermarkets, and flights between Europe (Istanbul-Mogadishu) since the collapse of central authority in 1991. This economic growth has yet to expand outside of Mogadishu, and within the city, security concerns dominate business.

48;South Sudan;Egypt attempted to colonize the region of southern Sudan by establishing the province of Equatoria in the 1870s. Islamic Mahdist revolutionaries overran the region in 1885, but in 1898 a British force was able to overthrow the Mahdist regime. An Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was established the following year with Equatoria being the southernmost of its eight provinces. The isolated region was largely left to itself over the following decades, but Christian missionaries converted much of the population and facilitated the spread of English. When Sudan gained its independence in 1956, it was with the understanding that the southerners would be able to participate fully in the political system. When the Arab Khartoum government reneged on its promises, a mutiny began that led to two prolonged periods of conflict (1955-1972 and 1983-2005) in which perhaps 2.5 million people died - mostly civilians - due to starvation and drought. Ongoing peace talks finally resulted in a Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in January 2005. As part of this agreement the south was granted a six-year period of autonomy to be followed by a referendum on final status. The result of this referendum, held in January 2011, was a vote of 98% in favor of secession. Independence was attained on 9 July 2011. Since independence South Sudan has struggled with good governance and nation building and has attempted to control rebel militia groups operating in its territory. Economic conditions have deteriorated since January 2012 when the government decided to shut down oil production following bilateral disagreements with Sudan.;;East-Central Africa;8 00 N, 30 00 E;<a

Subsistence agriculture provides a living for the vast majority of the population. Property rights are insecure and price signals are weak, because markets are not well organized. South Sudan has little infrastructure - approximately 250 of paved roads. Electricity is produced mostly by costly diesel generators and indoor plumbing and potable water are scarce. South Sudan depends largely on imports of goods, services, and capital - mainly from Uganda, Kenya and Sudan. Nevertheless, South Sudan does have abundant natural resources. At independence in 2011, South Sudan produced nearly three-fourths of former Sudan's total oil output of nearly a half million barrels per day. The government of South Sudan derives nearly 98% of its budget revenues from oil. Oil is exported through two pipelines that run to refineries and shipping facilities at Port Sudan on the Red Sea. The economy of South Sudan will remain linked to Sudan for some time, given the long lead time and great expense required to build another pipeline, should the government decide to do so. In January 2012 South Sudan suspended production of oil because of its dispute with Sudan over transshipment fees. This suspension lasted fifteen months and had a devastating impact on GDP, which declined by 48% in 2012. With the resumption of oil flows the economy rebounded strongly during the second half of calendar year 2013. This occurred in spite of the fact that oil production, at an average level of 222,000 barrels per day, was 40% lower compared with 2011, prior to the shutdown. GDP is estimated to have grown by about 25% in 2013. However, the outbreak of conflict on December 15, 2013 combined with a further reduction of oil exports, means that GDP growth forecasts for 2014 are being revised downwards again, and poverty and food insecurity are rising. South Sudan holds one of the richest agricultural areas in Africa with fertile soils and abundant water supplies. Currently the region supports 10-20 million head of cattle. South Sudan is currently burdened by considerable debt, accrued largely in 2012, based on rapidly accumulating arrears, and increased military spending. South Sudan has received more than $4 billion in foreign aid since 2005, largely from the UK, the US, Norway, and the Netherlands. Following independence, South Sudan's central bank issued a new currency, the South Sudanese Pound, allowing a short grace period for turning in the old currency. Annual inflation peaked at 79.5% in May 2012 but declined rapidly thereafter, to an average of 1.7% in 2013. Following the December 2013 outbreak of violence, inflation is on the rise again. Long-term challenges include diversifying the formal economy, alleviating poverty, maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving tax collection and financial management and improving the business environment.;$14.71 billion (2013 est.)<br />$11.79 billion (2012 est.)<br />$22.49 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$11.77 billion (2013 est.);24.7% (2013 est.)<br />-47.6% (2012 est.);$1,400 (2013 est.)<br />$1,100 (2012 est.)<br />$2,300 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>34.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>17.1%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>10.4%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>64.9%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-27.2%<br />(2011 est.);;sorghum, maize, rice, millet, wheat, gum arabic, sugarcane, mangoes, papayas, bananas, sweet potatoes, sunflower seeds, cotton, sesame seeds, cassava (manioc, tapioca), beans, peanuts;;;;;;;50.6% (2009 est.);46 (2010 est.);<i>revenues: </i>$437 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.259 billion (FY 2013 est.);3.7% of GDP (FY 2013 est.);-15.5% of GDP (FY 2013 est.);;;1.7% (2013 est.)<br />79% (May 2012 est.);;;$1.873 billion (31 December 2013)<br />$2.032 billion (31 December 2012);$2.194 billion (31 December 2013)<br />$2.23 billion (31 December 2012);;;;;;;;;;;;;;South Sudanese pounds (SSP) per US dollar -<br />0.7634 (2013 est.)<br />0.7752 (2012 est.);;881.3 million kWh (2010 est.);694.1 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);255,200 kW (2010 est.);30.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);66.3% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);3% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);220,000 bbl/day (Second half of 20);291,800 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);3.75 billion bbl (1 January 2013 est.);;;;13,050 bbl/day;0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);63.71 billion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);2.016 million Mt (2011 est.);2,200 (2012);2 million (2012);<i>international: </i>country code - 211;TV is controlled by the government;.ss;;;;85 (2013);<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>2 (2013);<i>total: </i>82<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>12<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>35<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>34 (2013);1 (2013);;248 km;7,000 km;see entry for Sudan;;;;Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA);18 is the legal minimum age for compulsory and voluntary military service;;;;10.32% of GDP (2012)<br />5.8% of GDP (2011)<br />10.32% of GDP (2010);;South Sudan-Sudan boundary represents 1 January 1956 alignment, final alignment pending negotiations and demarcation;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>218,534 (Sudan);<i>current situation: </i>South Sudan is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;
49;Sudan;Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have dominated national politics since independence from Anglo-Egyptian co rule in 1956. Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in northern economic, political, and social domination of largely non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in 1972 but another broke out in 1983. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years followed by a referendum on independence for Southern Sudan. The referendum was held in January 2011 and indicated overwhelming support for independence. South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011. Sudan and South Sudan have yet to fully implement security and economic agreements signed on September 27, 2012 relating to the normalization of relations between the two countries. The final disposition of the contested Abyei region has also to be decided. Since South Sudan's independence, conflict has broken out between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, which has resulted in 1.2 million internally displaced persons or severely affected persons in need of humanitarian assistance. A separate conflict, which broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003, has displaced nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 deaths. Violence in Darfur in 2013 resulted in an additional estimated 6,000 civilians killed and 500,000 displaced. The UN and the African Union have jointly commanded a Darfur peacekeeping operation known as the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) since 2007. Peacekeeping troops have struggled to stabilize the situation and have increasingly become targets for attacks by armed groups. In 2013, 16 peacekeepers were killed, UNAMID's deadliest year so far. Sudan also has faced refugee influxes from neighboring countries, primarily Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and government denial of access have impeded the provision of humanitarian assistance to affected populations.;;north-eastern Africa, bordering the Red

in July 2011, the loss of three-quarters of its oil production due to the secession of South Sudan. The oil sector had driven much of Sudan's GDP growth since 1999. For nearly a decade, the economy boomed on the back of rising oil production, high oil prices, and significant inflows of foreign direct investment. Since the economic shock of South Sudan's secession, Sudan has struggled to stabilize its economy and make up for the loss of foreign exchange earnings. The interruption of oil production in South Sudan in 2012 for over a year and the consequent loss of oil transit fees further exacerbated the fragile state of Sudan’s economy. Sudan is also subject to comprehensive US sanctions. Sudan is attempting to develop non-oil sources of revenues, such as gold mining, while carrying out an austerity program to reduce expenditures. The world’s largest exporter of gum Arabic, Sudan produces 75-80% of the world’s total output. Agriculture continues to employ 80% of the work force. Sudan introduced a new currency, still called the Sudanese pound, following South Sudan's secession, but the value of the currency has fallen since its introduction. Khartoum formally devalued the currency in June 2012, when it passed austerity measures that included gradually repealing fuel subsidies. Sudan also faces rising inflation, which reached 47% on an annual basis in November 2012, but subsided to 25% in 2013. Ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Darfur, and the Blue Nile states, lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture keep close to half of the population at or below the poverty line.;$89.97 billion (2013 est.)<br />$86.59 billion (2012 est.)<br />$89.51 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US

Tanzania has largely completed its transition to a liberalized market economy, though the government retains a presence in sectors such as telecommunications, banking, energy, and mining. The economy depends on agriculture, which accounts for more than one-quarter of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs about 80% of the work force. The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging economic infrastructure, including rail and port infrastructure that are important trade links for inland countries. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private-sector growth and investment, and the government has increased spending on agriculture to 7% of its budget. The financial sector in Tanzania has expanded in recent years and foreign-owned banks account for about 48% of the banking industry's total assets. Competition among foreign commercial banks has resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency and quality of financial services, though interest rates are still relatively high, reflecting high fraud risk. All land in Tanzania is owned by the government, which can lease land for up to 99 years. Proposed reforms to allow for land ownership, particularly foreign land ownership, remain unpopular. Continued donor assistance and solid macroeconomic policies supported a positive growth rate, despite the world recession. In 2008, Tanzania received the world's largest Millennium Challenge Compact grant, worth $698 million, and in December 2012 the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Tanzania for a second Compact. Dar es Salaam used fiscal stimulus and loosened monetary policy to ease the impact of the global recession. GDP growth in 2009-13 was a respectable 6-7% per year due to high gold prices and increased production.;$79.29 billion (2013 est.)<br />$74.12 billion (2012 est.)<br />$69.31 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$31.94 billion (2013 est.);7% (2013 est.)<br />6.9% (2012 est.)<br />6.4% (2011 est.);$1,700 (2013 est.)<br />$1,600 (2012 est.)<br />$1,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;25.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />25.2% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />17.4% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>60.3%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>17.2%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>40.2%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.6%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>30.1%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-48.5%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>27.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>25%<br /><i>services: </i>47.4% (2013 est.);coffee, sisal, tea, cotton, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums), cashew nuts, tobacco, cloves, corn, wheat, cassava (manioc, tapioca), bananas, fruits, vegetables;agricultural processing (sugar, beer, cigarettes, sisal twine);7.4% (2013 est.);25.59 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>80%<br /><i>industry and services: </i>20% (2002 est.);NA%;<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.8%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>29.6% (2007);36% (2002 est.);37.6 (2007)<br />34.6 (2000);<i>revenues: </i>$7.117 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$8.917 billion (2013 est.);22.3% of GDP (2013 est.);-5.6% of GDP (2013 est.);42.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />41.7% of GDP (2012 est.);1 July -

52;Togo;French Togoland became Togo in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA, installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multi-party elections instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007. After years of political unrest and condemnation from international organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being re-welcomed into the international community.;;Western Africa,

Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and cotton generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the most important cash crop. Togo is among the world's largest producers of phosphate and Togo seeks to develop its carbonate phosphate reserves. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly. Progress depends on follow through on privatization, increased openness in government financial operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued support from foreign donors. Foreign direct investment inflows have slowed over recent years. Togo completed its IMF Extended Credit Facility in 2011 and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in 2010 at which 95% of the country's debt was forgiven.

53;Tunisia;Rivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a protectorate. Agitation for independence in the decades following World War I was finally successful in getting the French to recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup. Street protests that began in Tunis in December 2010 over high unemployment, corruption, widespread poverty, and high food prices escalated in January 2011, culminating in rioting that led to hundreds of deaths. On 14 January 2011, the same day BEN ALI dismissed the government, he fled the country, and by late January 2011, a &quot;;Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Libya;34 00 N, 9 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/africa.pdf">Africa</a>;<i>total: </i>163,610 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>155,360 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>8,250 sq km;slightly larger than Georgia<br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/pdf/../../areacomparison/TS_area%202014.jpg">Area comparison map</a>;<i>total: </i>1,424 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Algeria 965 km, Libya 459 km;1,148 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>12 nm;temperate in north with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers;mountains in north;<i>lowest point: </i>Shatt al Gharsah -17 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Jebel ech Chambi 1,544 m;petroleum, phosphates, iron ore, lead, zinc, salt;<i>arable land: </i>17.35%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>14.63%<br /><i>other: </i>68.02% (2011);3,970 sq km (2003);4.6 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>2.85 cu km/yr (14%/4%/82%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>295.8 cu m/yr (2001);NA;toxic and hazardous waste disposal is ineffective and poses health risks;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Marine Life Conservation;strategic location in central Mediterranean;<i>noun: </i>Tunisian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Tunisian;Arab 98%, European 1%, Jewish and other 1%;Arabic (official, one of the languages of commerce), French (commerce), Berber (Tamazight);Muslim (official;;10,937,521 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>23% (male 1,298,262/female 1,219,086)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>16% (male 879,755/female 871,954)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>44.6% (male 2,373,765/female 2,509,750)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>8.4% (male 468,278/female 454,170)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>7.7% (male 423,350/female 439,151) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>43.9 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>33.4 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>10.5 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>9.5 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>31.4 years<br /><i>male: </i>31 years<br /><i>female: </i>31.8 years (2014 est.);0.92% (2014 est.);16.9 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);5.94 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-1.74 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>66.3% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.34% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);TUNIS (capital) 790,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.07 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.07 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.01 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>0.95 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.99 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.96 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.99 male(s)/female (2014 est.);56 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>23.19 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>26.63 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>19.51 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>75.68 years<br /><i>male: </i>73.6 years<br /><i>female: </i>77.9 years (2014 est.);63% (2012);2 children born/woman (2014 est.);6.2% of GDP (2011);1.22 physicians/1,000 population (2010);2.1 beds/1,000 population (2010);<i>improved: </i>urban: 100% of population<br />rural: 90.5% of population<br />total: 96.8% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 0% of population<br />rural: 9.5% of population<br />total: 3.2% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 97.4% of population<br />rural: 76.6% of population<br />total: 90.4% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 2.6% of population<br />rural: 23.4% of population<br />total: 9.6% of population (2012 est.);0.1% (2012 est.);2,300 (2012 est.);100 (2012 est.);;22.3% (2008);3.3% (2006);6.2% of GDP (2012);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>79.1%<br /><i>male: </i>87.4%<br /><i>female: </i>71.1% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>15 years<br /><i>male: </i>14 years<br /><i>female: </i>15 years (2010);;<i>total: </i>42.3% (2011);;;<i>conventional long form: </i>Tunisian Republic<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Tunisia<br /><i>local long form: </i>Al Jumhuriyah at Tunisiyah<br /><i>local short form: </i>Tunis;;;republic;;<i>name: </i>Tunis<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>36 48 N, 10 11 E<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time);24 governorates (wilayat, singular -

Following an ill-fated experiment with socialist economic policies in the 1960s, Tunisia embarked on a successful strategy focused on bolstering exports, foreign investment, and tourism, all of which have become central to the country's economy. Key exports now include textiles and apparel, food products, petroleum products, chemicals, and phosphates, with about 80% of exports bound for Tunisia's main economic partner, the European Union. Tunisia's liberal strategy, coupled with investments in education and infrastructure, fueled decades of 4-5% annual GDP growth and improving living standards. Former President (1987-2011) Zine el Abidine BEN ALI continued these policies, but as his reign wore on cronyism and corruption stymied economic performance and unemployment rose among the country's growing ranks of university graduates. These grievances contributed to the January 2011 overthrow of BEN ALI, sending Tunisia's economy into a tailspin as tourism and investment declined sharply. During 2012 and 2013, the Tunisian Government’s focus on the political transition led to a neglect of the economy that resulted in several downgrades of Tunisia’s credit rating. As the economy recovers, Tunisia's government faces challenges reassuring businesses and investors, bringing budget and current account deficits under control, shoring up the country's financial system, bringing down high unemployment, and reducing economic disparities between the more developed coastal region and the impoverished interior.;$108.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$105.4 billion (2012

Uganda has never conducted a national minerals survey. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.

55;Western Sahara;Western Sahara is a disputed territory on the northwest coast of Africa bordered by Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria. After Spain withdrew from its former colony of Spanish Sahara in 1976, Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco's sovereignty ended in a 1991 cease-fire and the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation. As part of this effort, the UN sought to offer a choice to the peoples of the Western Sahara between independence (favored by the Polisario Front) or integration into Morocco. A proposed referendum never took place due to lack of agreement on voter eligibility. The 2,700 km- (1,700 mi-) long defensive sand berm, built by the Moroccans from 1980 to 1987 and running the length of the territory, continues to separate the opposing forces with Morocco controlling the roughly 80 percent of the territory west of the berm. Local demonstrations criticizing the Moroccan authorities occur regularly, and there are periodic ethnic tensions between the native Sahrawi population and Moroccan immigrants.

The territory's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture difficult, and Western Sahara imports much of its food. The Moroccan Government administers Western Sahara's economy and is a key source of employment, infrastructure development, and social spending in the territory. Western Sahara's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco and the EU in December 2013 finalized a four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast of Morocco, including disputed waters off the coast of Western Sahara. Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially significant quantities, but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory. Western Sahara's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory.;$906.5 million (2007 est.);$NA;NA%;$2,500 (2007 est.);;;<i>agriculture: </i>NA%<br /><i>industry: </i>NA%<br /><i>services: </i>40% (2007 est.);fruits and vegetables (grown in the few oases);phosphate mining, handicrafts;NA%;144,000 (2010 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>50%<br /><i>industry and services: </i>50% (2005 est.);NA%;<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$NA<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$NA;;;;calendar year;NA%;;;;;;;;$NA;phosphates 62%;;$NA;fuel for fishing fleet, foodstuffs;;;$NA;;;Moroccan dirhams (MAD) per US dollar -<br />8.439 (2013)<br />8.6026 (2012)<br />8.4172 (2010)<br />8.0571 (2009)<br />7.526 (2008);;90 million kWh (2010 est.);83.7 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);58,000 kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,948 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,702 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);316,700 Mt (2011 est.);;;<i>general assessment: </i>sparse and limited system<br /><i>domestic: </i>NA<br /><i>international: </i>country code - 212;Morocco's state-owned broadcaster, Radio-Television Marocaine (RTM), operates a radio service from Laayoune and relays TV service;.eh;;;;6 (2013);<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>3 (2013);<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);;;;;;;<i>major seaport(s): </i>Ad Dakhla, Laayoune (El Aaiun);;;;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>79,489<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>87,362 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>5,523<br /><i>female: </i>5,429 (2010 est.);;;many neighboring states reject Moroccan administration of Western Sahara;;;
56;Zambia;The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the [British] South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper prices, economic mismanagement and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991 brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996 saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001 was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate Levy MWANAWASA. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election that was deemed free and fair. Upon his abrupt death in August 2008, he was succeeded by his vice president, Rupiah BANDA, who subsequently won a special presidential by-election in October 2008.

year. Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly increased copper mining output and profitability to spur economic growth. Copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and foreign investment. Zambia's dependency on copper makes it vulnerable to depressed commodity prices, but record high copper prices and a bumper maize crop in 2010 helped Zambia rebound quickly from the world economic slowdown that began in 2008. Zambia has made some strides to improve the ease of doing business. Regulatory changes by the current government in 2012-2013 included Statutory Instruments (SI) Number 33 (mandating use of the kwacha for domestic transactions) and SI Number 55 (monitoring foreign exchange transactions). Along with problems of fiscal management and weakening global copper prices, these SI's were perceived as undermining confidence in Zambia's economy and currency, leading to sharp depreciation of the kwacha in March 2014. In response, the Minister of Finance revoked SI 33 and 55 in late March 2014. Despite a strong economy, poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia, made worse by a high birth rate, relatively high HIV/AIDS burden, and by market distorting agricultural policies.;$25.47

57;Zimbabwe;The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 1997 and intensified after 2000, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. In April 2005, the capital city of Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months;;Southern Africa, between South Africa and Zambia;20 00

Following a decade of contraction from 1998 to 2008, Zimbabwe's economy recorded real growth of roughly 10% per year in 2010-11, before slowing in 2012-13 due poor harvests and low diamond revenues. The government of Zimbabwe faces a number of difficult economic problems, including infrastructure and regulatory deficiencies, ongoing indigenization pressure, policy uncertainty, a large external debt burden, and insufficient formal employment. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing hyperinflation. Dollarization in early 2009 - which allowed currencies such as the Botswana pula, the South Africa rand, and the US dollar to be used locally - ended hyperinflation and reduced inflation below 10% per year, but exposed structural weaknesses that continue to inhibit broad-based growth.;$7.496 billion (2013 est.)<br />$7.265 billion (2012 est.)<br />$6.957 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b>

and features low unemployment, contained inflation, very low public debt, and a strong and stable financial system. By 2012, Australia had experienced more than 20 years of continued economic growth, averaging 3.5% a year. Demand for resources and energy from Asia and especially China has grown rapidly, creating a channel for resources investments and growth in commodity exports. The high Australian dollar has hurt the manufacturing sector, while the services sector is the largest part of the Australian economy, accounting for about 70% of GDP and 75% of jobs. Australia was comparatively unaffected by the global financial crisis as the banking system has remained strong and inflation is under control. Australia has benefited from a dramatic surge in its terms of trade in recent years, stemming from rising global commodity prices. Australia is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal, iron, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy sources. A series of major investments, such as the US$40 billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand the resources sector. Australia is an open market with minimal restrictions on imports of goods and services. The process of opening up has increased productivity, stimulated growth, and made the economy more flexible and dynamic. Australia plays an active role in the World Trade Organization, APEC, the G20, and other trade forums. Australia has bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the US, has a regional FTA with ASEAN and New Zealand, is negotiating agreements with China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, as well as with its Pacific neighbors and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and is also working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement with Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US, and Vietnam.;$998.3 billion (2013 est.)<br />$974.2 billion (2012 est.)<br />$939.7 billion

The island existed as a separate Crown colony from 1 January 1958 to 1 October 1958 when its transfer to Australian jurisdiction was finalized.

66;Cocos (Keeling) Islands;There are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978, members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. Apart from North Keeling Island, which lies 30 kilometers north of the main group, the islands form a horseshoe-shaped atoll surrounding a lagoon. North Keeling Island was declared a national park in 1995 and is administered by Parks Australia.

Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt.

Sugar exports, remittances from Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with 400,000 to 500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights, and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly. Fiji's current account deficit peaked at 23% of GDP in 2006, and declined to less than 12% of GDP in 2013.;$4.45 billion (2013 est.)<br />$4.319 billion (2012 est.)<br />$4.226 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$4.218 billion (2013 est.);3% (2013 est.)<br />2.2% (2012 est.)<br />1.9% (2011 est.);$4,900 (2013 est.)<br />$4,800 (2012 est.)<br />$4,700 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>90.4%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>22.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>39.7%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-68.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>11.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>18.1%<br /><i>services: </i>70.2% (2013 est.);sugarcane, coconuts, cassava (manioc, tapioca), rice, sweet potatoes, bananas;tourism, sugar, clothing, copra, gold, silver, lumber, small cottage industries;2.5% (2013 est.);335,000 (2007 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>70%<br /><i>industry and services: </i>30% (2001 est.);7.6% (1999);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.6%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>34.9% (2009 est.);31% (2009 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$1.084 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.192 billion (2013 est.);25.7% of GDP (2013 est.);-2.6% of GDP (2013 est.);56.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />53.5% of GDP (2012 est.);calendar year;3% (2013 est.)<br />4.4% (2012 est.);1.75% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />3% (31 December 2009 est.);6.2% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />7% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.549 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.453 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.697 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.578 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.168 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.958 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$452.5 million (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$392.2 million (31 December 2011)<br />$418.8 million (31 December 2010 est.);-$492.3 million (2013 est.)<br />-$425.1 million (2012 est.);$1.026 billion (2013 est.)<br />$932.4 million (2012 est.);sugar, garments, gold, timber, fish, molasses, coconut oil;US 14.6%, Australia 13.2%, Japan 6.9%, Samoa 5.8%, Tonga 5.1% (2012);$2.054 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.867 billion (2012 est.);manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, petroleum products, food, chemicals;Singapore 32.8%, Australia 15.5%, NZ 14.5%, China 10.7% (2012);$963.7 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$921.4 million (31 December 2012 est.);$779.9 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$685.5 million (31 December 2012 est.);$3.17 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.903 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$43.03 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$44.08 million (31 December 2012 est.);Fijian dollars (FJD) per US dollar -<br />1.845 (2013 est.)<br />1.7899 (2012 est.)<br />1.9183 (2010 est.);;836.1 million kWh (2011 est.);808.3 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);245,100 kW (2010 est.);49% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);45.3% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);5.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);30 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);17,810 bbl/day (2011 est.);692 bbl/day (2010 est.);10,050 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.445 million Mt (2011 est.);88,400 (2012);858,800 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>modern local, interisland, and international (wire/radio integrated) public and special-purpose telephone, telegraph, and teleprinter facilities;Fiji TV, a publicly traded company, operates a free-to-air channel as well as Sky Fiji and Sky Pacific multi-channel pay-TV services;.fj;21,739 (2012);114,200 (2009);;28 (2013);<i>total: </i>4<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2 (2013);<i>total: </i>24<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>5<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>19 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>597 km<br /><i>narrow gauge: </i>597 km 0.600-m gauge<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>belongs to the government-owned Fiji Sugar Corporation;<i>total: </i>3,440 km<br /><i>paved: </i>1,686 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>1,754 km (2011);203 km (122 km are navigable by motorized craft and 200-metric-ton barges) (2012);<i>total: </i>11<br /><i>by type: </i>passenger 4, passenger/cargo 4, refrigerated cargo 1, roll on/roll off 2<br /><i>foreign-owned: </i>2 (Australia 2) (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Lautoka, Levuka, Suva;;Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF): Land Forces, Naval Forces (2011);18 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>233,240<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>222,587 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>183,730<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>188,325 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>8,403<br /><i>female: </i>8,039 (2010 est.);1.47% of GDP (2012)<br />1.44% of GDP (2011)<br />1.47% of GDP (2010);;none;;;

Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more than one-fifth of GDP. Private sector initiatives and a financial sector are in the early stages of development.

77;New Zealand;The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D. 800. In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain, the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights. That same year, the British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both world wars. New Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances.;;Oceania, islands in the South Pacific Ocean, southeast of Australia;41 00 S, 174 00 E;<a

market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers.

Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid from New Zealand in FY08/09 was US$5.7 million.

The country remains dependent on external aid and remittances from Tongan communities overseas to offset its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had 39,000 visitors in 2006. The government is emphasizing the development of the private sector, especially the encouragement of investment, and is committing increased funds for health and education. Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and well developed social services.

Only eight of the atolls are inhabited. The country has no known mineral resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average, visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad, and remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $2 million in 2007. Substantial income is received annually from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals, this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TTF contributed nearly $9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure financial stability and sustainability, the government is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts.

89;Vanuatu;Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct language, migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding European exploration in the 18th century. This settlement pattern accounts for the complex linguistic diversity found on the archipelago to this day. The British and French, who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium, which administered the islands until independence in 1980, when the new name of

In December 1941, the island was captured by the Japanese and held until the end of World War II. In subsequent years, Wake became a stopover and refueling site for military and commercial aircraft transiting the Pacific. Since 1974, the island's airstrip has been used by the US military, as well as for emergency landings. Operations on the island were suspended and all personnel evacuated in 2006 with the approach of super typhoon IOKE (category 5), but resultant damage was comparatively minor.

91;Wallis and Futuna;The Futuna island group was discovered by the Dutch in 1616 and Wallis by the British in 1767, but it was the French who declared a protectorate over the islands in 1842, and took official control of them between 1886 and 1888. Notably, Wallis and Futuna was the only French colony to side with the Vichy regime during World War II, a phase that ended in May of 1942 with the arrival of 2,000 American troops.

The dual-island nation's agricultural production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US, Canada, and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters. After taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government adopted an ambitious fiscal reform program and was successful in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from approximately 130% in 2010 to 89% in 2012. In 2009, Antigua's economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis and suffered from the collapse of its largest private sector employer, a steep decline in tourism, a rise in debt, and a sharp economic contraction between 2009-11.

A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry. Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Tourist arrivals have rebounded strongly following a dip after the 11 September 2001 attacks. Tourism now accounts for over 80 % of economic activity. Over 1.5 million tourists per year visit Aruba, with 75% of those from the US. The rapid growth of the tourism sector has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction continues to boom with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. Aruba is heavily dependent on imports and is making efforts to expand exports to achieve a more desirable trade balance. Aruba weathered two major shocks in recent years: fallout from the global financial crisis, which had its largest impact on tourism, and the closure of its oil refinery in 2009. Economic recovery is progressing gradually, but output is still 12% below its pre-crisis level.

Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined with business services, account for about 35% of GDP. Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute less than a 10th of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. The economy of The Bahamas shrank at an average pace of 0.8% annually between 2007-2011, and tourism, financial services, and construction - pillars of the national economy - remain subdued. Conditions are improving in the tourism sector, however, due to steady foreign investment led activity. New resort and marina developments are likely to provide sustained employment opportunities.;$11.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$11.19 billion (2012 est.)<br />$10.98 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$8.373 billion (2013 est.);1.9% (2013 est.)<br />1.8% (2012 est.)<br />1.7% (2011 est.);$32,000 (2013 est.)<br />$31,800 (2012 est.)<br />$31,500 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;14.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />19.3% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />17.8% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>68.7%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>15.5%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>34.4%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>45.8%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-64.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>2.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>7.1%<br /><i>services: </i>90.8% (2013 est.);citrus, vegetables;tourism, banking, oil bunkering, maritime industries, transshipment, salt, rum, aragonite, pharmaceuticals;1.5% (2013 est.);196,900 (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>3%<br /><i>industry: </i>11%<br /><i>tourism: </i>49%<br /><i>other services: </i>37% (2011 est.);16.2% (2013 est.)<br />14% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>1%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>22% (2007);9.3% (2010 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$1.41 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.1 billion (2012 est.);16.8% of GDP (2012 est.);-8.2% of GDP (2012 est.);;1 July -

The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the UK in 1966.

Historically, the Barbadian economy was dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities. However, in recent years the economy has diversified into light industry and tourism with about four-fifths of GDP and of exports being attributed to services. Offshore finance and information services are important foreign exchange earners and thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US financial centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. Barbados' tourism, financial services, and construction industries have been hard hit since the onset of the global economic crisis in 2008. Barbados' public debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 56% in 2008 to 90.5% in 2013.

About 16% of Belizeans live abroad, while immigrants constitute approximately 15% of Belize's population. Belizeans seeking job and educational opportunities have preferred to emigrate to the United States rather than former colonizer Great Britain because of the United States' closer proximity and stronger trade ties with Belize. Belizeans also emigrate to Canada, Mexico, and English-speaking Caribbean countries. The emigration of a large share of Creoles (Afro-Belizeans) and the influx of Central American immigrants, mainly Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans, has changed Belize's ethnic composition. Mestizos have become the largest ethnic group, and Belize now has more native Spanish speakers than English or Creole speakers, despite English being the official language. In addition, Central American immigrants are establishing new communities in rural areas, which contrasts with the urbanization trend seen in neighboring countries. Recently, Chinese, European, and North American immigrants have become more frequent.<br />Immigration accounts for an increasing share of Belize's population growth rate, which is steadily falling due to fertility decline. Belize's declining birth rate and its increased life expectancy are creating an aging population. As the elderly population grows and nuclear families replace extended households, Belize's government will be challenged to balance a rising demand for pensions, social services, and healthcare for its senior citizens with the need to reduce poverty and social inequality and to improve sanitation.;340,844 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>35.3% (male 61,480/female 59,000)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>21% (male 36,432/female 35,093)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>35.5% (male 61,112/female 59,809)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>4.6% (male 7,719/female 7,807)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>3.6% (male 5,848/female 6,544) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>59.7 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>53.3 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>6.4 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>15.6 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>21.8 years<br /><i>male: </i>21.6 years<br /><i>female: </i>22 years (2014 est.);1.92% (2014 est.);25.14 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);5.95 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>44.7% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.54% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);BELMOPAN (capital) 14,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1.02 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>1.03 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.9 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>1.03 male(s)/female (2014 est.);53 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>20.31 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>22.78 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>17.7 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>68.49 years<br /><i>male: </i>66.88 years<br /><i>female: </i>70.17 years (2014 est.);55.2% (2011);3.02 children born/woman (2014 est.);5.7% of GDP (2011);0.83 physicians/1,000 population (2009);1.1 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 98.4% of population<br />rural: 100% of population<br />total: 99.3% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 1.6% of population<br />rural: 0% of population<br />total: 0.7% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 94.2% of population<br />rural: 87.6% of population<br />total: 90.5% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 5.8% of population<br />rural: 12.4% of population<br />total: 9.5% of population (2012 est.);1.4% (2012 est.);3,100 (2012 est.);100 (2012 est.);<i>degree of risk: </i>high<br /><i>food or waterborne diseases: </i>bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever<br /><i>vectorborne diseases: </i>dengue fever and malaria (2013);33.7% (2008);6.2% (2011);6.6% of GDP (2010);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>76.9%<br /><i>male: </i>76.7%<br /><i>female: </i>77.1% (2000 census);<i>total: </i>14 years<br /><i>male: </i>13 years<br /><i>female: </i>14 years (2012);;<i>total: </i>19.5%<br /><i>male: </i>13.8%<br /><i>female: </i>28.8% (2005);;<i>total number: </i>27,751<br /><i>percentage: </i>40 % (2001 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>none<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Belize<br /><i>former: </i>British Honduras;;;parliamentary democracy and a Commonwealth realm;;<i>name: </i>Belmopan<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>17 15 N, 88 46 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-6 (1 hour behind Washington, DC, during Standard Time);6 districts;;;21 September 1981 (from the UK);Independence Day, 21 September (1981);previous 1954, 1963 (preindependence);English common law;has not submitted an ICJ jurisdiction declaration;18 years of age;<i>chief of state: </i>Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952);bicameral National Assembly consists of the Senate (12 seats;<i>highest court(s): </i>Supreme Court of Judicature (consists of the Court of Appeal with the court president and 3 justices, and the Supreme Court with the chief justice and 2 judges)<br />note -

The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in September 1998, led to GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered this growth. Exploration efforts have continued and production has increased a small amount. Growth slipped to 0% in 2009, resulting from the global economic slowdown, natural disasters, and a temporary drop in the price of oil, but grew to 2.5% in 2013. With weak economic growth and a large public debt burden, fiscal spending is likely to be tight.

100;Costa Rica;Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century, initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, including disease from mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives, and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic development. In 1949, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.;;Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Nicaragua and Panama;10 00 N, 84 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/central_america.pdf">Central America and the Caribbean</a>;<i>total: </i>51,100 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>51,060 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>40 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Isla del Coco;slightly smaller than West Virginia;<i>total: </i>661 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Nicaragua 313 km, Panama 348 km;1,290 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 nm;tropical and subtropical;coastal plains separated by rugged mountains including over 100 volcanic cones, of which several are major volcanoes;<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Cerro Chirripo 3,810 m;hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>4.89%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>6.46%<br /><i>other: </i>88.65% (2011);1,031 sq km (2003);112.4 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>5.77 cu km/yr (15%/9%/77%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>1,582 cu m/yr (2006);occasional earthquakes, hurricanes along Atlantic coast;deforestation and land use change, largely a result of the clearing of land for cattle ranching and agriculture;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Marine Life Conservation;four volcanoes, two of them active, rise near the capital of San Jose in the center of the country;<i>noun: </i>Costa Rican(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Costa Rican;white or mestizo 83.6%, mulato 6.7%, indigenous 2.4%, black of African descent 1.1%, other 1.1%, none 2.9%, unspecified 2.2% (2011 est.);Spanish (official), English;Roman Catholic 76.3%, Evangelical 13.7%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.3%, other Protestant 0.7%, other 4.8%, none 3.2%;Costa Rica's political stability, high standard of living, and well-developed social benefits system set it apart from its Central American neighbors. Through the government's sustained social spending - almost 20% of GDP annually - Costa Rica has made tremendous progress toward achieving its goal of providing universal access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and electricity. Since the 1970s, expansion of these services has led to a rapid decline in infant mortality, an increase in life expectancy at birth, and a sharp decrease in the birth rate. The average number of children born per women has fallen from about 7 in the 1960s to 3.5 in the early 1980s to below replacement level today. Costa Rica's poverty rate is lower than in most Latin American countries, but it has stalled at around 20% for almost two decades.<br />Costa Rica is a popular regional immigration destination because of its job opportunities and social programs. Almost 9% of the population is foreign-born, with Nicaraguans comprising nearly three-quarters of the foreign population. Many Nicaraguans who perform unskilled seasonal labor enter Costa Rica illegally or overstay their visas, which continues to be a source of tension.

101;Cuba;The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. Subsequently, the 1901 Platt Amendment to the Cuban constitution authorized the US to intevene in Cuba in the event of instability. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians.

102;Curacao;Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire. Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit economically by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.;;Caribbean, an island in the Caribbean Sea - 55 km off the coast of Venezuela;12 10 N, 69 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/central_america.pdf">Central America and the Caribbean</a>;<i>total: </i>444 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>444 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km;more than twice the size of Washington, DC;0 km;364 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>exclusive fishing zone: </i>12 nm;tropical marine climate, ameliorated by northeast trade winds, results in mild temperatures;generally low, hilly terrain;<i>lowest point: </i>Caribbean Sea 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Mt.

It is well into its demographic transition, experiencing slower population growth, a decline in its number of youths, and the gradual aging of its population. The increased use of family planning has substantially lowered El Salvador's fertility rate, from approximately 6 children per woman in the 1970s to replacement level today. A 2008 national family planning survey showed that female sterilization remained the most common contraception method in El Salvador - its sterilization rate is among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean - but that the use of injectable contraceptives is growing. Fertility differences between rich and poor and urban and rural women are narrowing.<br />Salvadorans fled during the 1979 to 1992 civil war mainly to the United States but also to Canada and to neighboring Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Emigration to the United States increased again in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of deteriorating economic conditions, natural disasters (Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and earthquakes in 2001), and family reunification. At least 20% of El Salvador's population lives abroad. The remittances they send home account for close to 20% of GDP, are the second largest source of external income after exports, and have helped reduce poverty.;6,125,512 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>28.1% (male 882,185/female 837,646)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>20.8% (male 640,322/female 635,409)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>37.5% (male 1,056,779/female 1,243,220)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>6.6% (male 182,937/female 224,019)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>6.7% (male 187,664/female 235,331) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>57.6 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>46.2 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>11.4 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>8.8 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>25.6 years<br /><i>male: </i>24.1 years<br /><i>female: </i>27.1 years (2014 est.);0.27% (2014 est.);16.79 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);5.67 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-8.44 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>64.8% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.35% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);SAN SALVADOR (capital) 1.605 million (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.01 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>0.85 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.93 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.8 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.93 male(s)/female (2014 est.);81 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>18.44 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>20.52 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>16.27 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>74.18 years<br /><i>male: </i>70.9 years<br /><i>female: </i>77.62 years (2014 est.);72.5%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>percent of women aged 15-44 (2008);1.95 children born/woman (2014 est.);6.8% of GDP (2011);1.6 physicians/1,000 population (2008);1 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 95% of population<br />rural: 81% of population<br />total: 90.1% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 5.8% of population<br />rural: 19% of population<br />total: 9.9% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 79.5% of population<br />rural: 53.4% of population<br />total: 70.5% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 20.5% of population<br />rural: 46.6% of population<br />total: 29.5% of population (2012 est.);0.6% (2012 est.);24,900 (2012 est.);1,000 (2012 est.);<i>degree of risk: </i>high<br /><i>food or waterborne diseases: </i>bacterial and protozoal diarrhea<br /><i>vectorborne diseases: </i>dengue fever (2013);25.8% (2008);6.6% (2008);3.4% of GDP (2011);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>84.5%<br /><i>male: </i>87.1%<br /><i>female: </i>82.3% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>12 years<br /><i>male: </i>12 years<br /><i>female: </i>12 years (2012);20.8<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>median age at first birth among women 25-29 (2008 est.);<i>total: </i>12.4%<br /><i>male: </i>12.8%<br /><i>female: </i>11.7% (2012);;<i>total number: </i>179,303<br /><i>percentage: </i>4 %<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data represents children ages 5-17 (2007 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of El Salvador<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>El Salvador<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republica de El Salvador<br /><i>local short form: </i>El Salvador;;;republic;;<i>name: </i>San Salvador<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>13 42 N, 89 12 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-6 (1 hour behind Washington, DC, during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>none scheduled for 2014;14 departments (departamentos, singular -

With the global recession, real GDP contracted in 2009 and economic growth has since remained low, averaging less than 2% from 2010 to 2013. Remittances accounted for 16% of GDP in 2013 and were received by about a third of all households. In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has bolstered the export of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector amid increased Asian competition. The Salvadoran Government maintained fiscal discipline during post-war reconstruction and reconstruction following earthquakes in 2001 and hurricanes in 1998 and 2005, but El Salvador's external debt has been growing over the last several years, amounting to some 57% of GDP in 2013. In September 2013, El Salvador was awarded a $277 million second compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) - a United States Government agency aimed at stimulating economic growth and reducing poverty - to improve El Salvador's competitiveness and productivity in international markets.;$47.47 billion (2013 est.)<br />$46.72 billion (2012 est.)<br />$45.84 billion (2011 est.)<br

107;Guatemala;The Maya civilization flourished in Guatemala and surrounding regions during the first millennium A.D. After almost three centuries as a Spanish colony, Guatemala won its independence in 1821. During the second half of the 20th century, it experienced a variety of military and civilian governments, as well as a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement formally ending the internal conflict, which had left more than 200,000 people dead and had created, by some estimates, about 1 million refugees.;;Central America, bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between El Salvador and Mexico, and bordering the Gulf of Honduras (Caribbean Sea) between Honduras and Belize;15 30 N, 90 15 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/central_america.pdf">Central America and the Caribbean</a>;<i>total: </i>108,889 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>107,159 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>1,730 sq km;slightly smaller than Pennsylvania<br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/pdf/../../areacomparison/GT_area%202014.jpg">Area comparison map</a>;<i>total: </i>1,667 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Belize 266 km, El Salvador 199 km, Honduras 244 km, Mexico 958 km;400 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation;tropical;mostly mountains with narrow coastal plains and rolling limestone plateau;<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Volcan Tajumulco 4,211 m<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>highest point in Central America;petroleum, nickel, rare woods, fish, chicle, hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>13.78%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>8.68%<br /><i>other: </i>77.55% (2011);3,121 sq km (2003);111.3 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>3.46 cu km/yr (15%/31%/54%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>259.1 cu m/yr (2006);numerous volcanoes in mountains, with occasional violent earthquakes;deforestation in the Peten rainforest;<i>party to: </i>Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;no natural harbors on west coast;<i>noun: </i>Guatemalan(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Guatemalan;Mestizo (mixed Amerindian-Spanish - in local Spanish called Ladino) and European 59.4%, K'iche 9.1%, Kaqchikel 8.4%, Mam 7.9%, Q'eqchi 6.3%, other Mayan 8.6%, indigenous non-Mayan 0.2%, other 0.1% (2001 census);Spanish (official) 60%, Amerindian languages 40%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>there are 23 officially recognized Amerindian languages, including Quiche, Cakchiquel, Kekchi, Mam, Garifuna, and Xinca;Roman Catholic, Protestant, indigenous Mayan beliefs;Guatemala is a predominantly poor country that struggles in several areas of health and development, including infant, child, and maternal mortality, malnutrition, literacy, and contraceptive awareness and use. The country's large indigenous population is disproportionately affected. Guatemala is the most populous country in Central America and has the highest fertility rate in Latin America. It also has the highest population growth rate in Latin America, which is likely to continue because of its large reproductive-age population and high birth rate. Almost half of Guatemala's population is under age 19, making it the youngest population in Latin America. Guatemala's total fertility rate has slowly declined during the last few decades due in part to limited government-funded health programs. However, the birth rate is still more than three children per woman and is markedly higher among its rural and indigenous populations.<br />Guatemalans have a history of emigrating legally and illegally to Mexico, the United States, and Canada because of a lack of economic opportunity, political instability, and natural disasters. Emigration, primarily to the United States, escalated during the 1960 to 1996 civil war and accelerated after a peace agreement was signed.

108;Haiti;The native Taino - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when it was discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 - were virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first post-colonial black-led nation in the world, declaring its independence in 1804. Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has experienced political instability for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations. Continued instability and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti inaugurated a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. This was followed by contested elections in 2010 that resulted in the election of Haiti's current President, Michel MARTELLY. A massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with an epicenter about 25 km (15 mi) west of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed and some 1.5 million left homeless. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in this region over the last 200 years.;;Caribbean, western one-third of the island of Hispaniola, between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, west

Poverty, corruption, vulnerability to natural disasters, and low levels of education for much of the population are among Haiti's most serious impediments to economic growth. Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback in January 2010 when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring areas. Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the earthquake further inflicted $7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract. In 2011, the Haitian economy began recovering from the earthquake. However, two hurricanes adversely affected agricultural output and the low public capital spending slowed the recovery in 2012. Two-fifths of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic engagement under the Caribbean Basin Trade Preference Agreement (CBTPA) and the 2008 Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE II) Act helped increase apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the CBTPA and HOPE II until 2020 under the Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act;$13.42 billion (2013 est.)<br />$12.98 billion (2012 est.)<br />$12.62 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$8.287 billion (2013 est.);3.4% (2013 est.)<br />2.8% (2012 est.)<br />5.6% (2011 est.);$1,300 (2013 est.)<br />$1,200 (2012 est.)<br />$1,200 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;3.7% of GDP (2011 est.);;<i>agriculture: </i>24.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>19.9%<br /><i>services: </i>56% (2013 est.);coffee, mangoes, cocoa, sugarcane, rice, corn, sorghum;textiles, sugar refining, flour milling, cement, light assembly using imported parts;6% (2013 est.);4.81 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>shortage of skilled labor, unskilled labor abundant (2010 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>38.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>11.5%<br /><i>services: </i>50.4% (2010);40.6% (2010 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>widespread unemployment and underemployment;<i>lowest 10%: </i>0.7%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>47.7% (2001);80% (2003 est.);59.2 (2001);<i>revenues: </i>$1.989 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.437 billion (2013 est.);24% of GDP (2013 est.);-5.4% of GDP (2013 est.);;1 October - 30 September;6.3% (2013 est.)<br />6.3% (2012 est.);;9.2% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />8.93% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.151 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.107 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$3.509 billion (31 October 2012 est.)<br />$3.43 billion (31 December 2011 est.);$1.725 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.515 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;-$1.278 billion (2013 est.)<br />-$1.358 billion (2012 est.);$876.8 million (2013 est.)<br />$785 million (2012 est.);apparel, manufactures, oils, cocoa, mangoes, coffee;US 81.7% (2012);$2.697 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.679 billion (2012 est.);food, manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, fuels, raw materials;Dominican Republic 34.5%, US 26.2%, Netherlands Antilles 9.4%, China 7% (2012);$1.335 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.287 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.118 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$957.6 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.123 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$963.1 million (31 December 2012 est.);;gourdes (HTG) per US dollar -<br />43.53 (2013 est.)<br />41.95 (2012 est.)<br />39.8 (2010 est.)<br />42.02 (2009)<br />39.216 (2008);;726 million kWh (2012 est.);208.5 million kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);130,000 kW (2012 est.);79% of total installed capacity (2011 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2011 est.);21% of total installed capacity (2011 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2011 est.);14,000 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);15,130 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);2.103 million Mt (2011 est.);50,000 (2012);6.095 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>telecommunications infrastructure is among the least developed in Latin America and the Caribbean;several TV stations, including 1 government-owned;.ht;555 (2012);1 million (2009);;14 (2013);<i>total: </i>4<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>2<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2 (2013);<i>total: </i>10<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>8 (2013);;;;<i>total: </i>4,266 km<br /><i>paved: </i>768 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>3,498 km (2009);;;<i>major seaport(s): </i>Cap-Haitien, Gonaives, Jacmel, Port-au-Prince;;no regular military forces - small Coast Guard;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>2,398,804<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>2,415,039 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,666,324<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,704,364 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>115,246<br /><i>female: </i>115,282 (2010 est.);;;since 2004, peacekeepers from the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti have assisted in maintaining civil order in Haiti;<i>IDPs: </i>137,000 (includes only IDPs from the 2010 earthquake living in camps or camp-like situations;<i>current situation: </i>Haiti is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;Caribbean transshipment point for cocaine en route to the US and Europe

After two and a half decades of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to power in 1982.

The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion in damage.

More than half of the population lives in poverty and per capita income is one of the lowest in the region. Poverty rates are higher among rural and indigenous people and in the south, west, and along the eastern border than in the north and central areas where most of Honduras' industries and infrastructure are concentrated. The increased productivity needed to break Honduras' persistent high poverty rate depends, in part, on further improvements in educational attainment. Although primary-school enrollment is near 100%, educational quality is poor, the drop-out rate and grade repetition remain high, and teacher and school accountability is low.<br />Honduras' population growth rate has slowed since the 1990s, but it remains high at nearly 2% annually because the birth rate averages approximately three children per woman and more among rural, indigenous, and poor women. Consequently, Honduras' young adult population - ages 15 to 29 - is projected to continue growing rapidly for the next three decades and then stabilize or slowly shrink. Population growth and limited job prospects outside of agriculture will continue to drive emigration.

110;Jamaica;The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually increased its independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy.;;Caribbean, island in the Caribbean Sea, south of Cuba;18 15 N, 77 30 W;<a

The bauxite/alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry and remittance flow remained resilient. Jamaica's economy faces many challenges to growth: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 140%. The attendant debt servicing cost consumes a large portion of the government's budget, limiting its ability to fund the critical infrastructure and social programs required to drive growth. Jamaica's economic growth rate in the recent past has been stagnant, averaging less than 1% per year for over 20 years. Jamaica's onerous public debt burden is largely the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy, most notably to the financial sector. In early 2010, the Jamaican Government initiated the Jamaica Debt Exchange to retire high-priced domestic bonds and reduce annual debt servicing. Despite these efforts, debt continued to be a serious concern, forcing the government to negotiate and sign a new IMF agreement in May 2013 to gain access to approximately $1 billion additional funds. As a precursor, the government instigated a second National Debt Exchange in 2012. The IMF deal requires the government to reform its tax system, eliminate discretionary tax exemptions and waivers, and achieve an annual surplus of 7.5%, excluding debt payments, to reduce its debt below 100% of GDP by 2020. The SIMPSON-MILLER administration now faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline to maintain debt payments while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade.

113;Nicaragua;The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006 and reelected in 2011. The 2008 municipal elections, 2010 regional elections, 2011 presidential elections, 2012 municipal elections, and 2013 regional elections were marred by widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration.;;Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Costa Rica and Honduras;13 00 N, 85 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/central_america.pdf">Central America and the Caribbean</a>;<i>total: </i>130,370 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>119,990 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>10,380 sq km;slightly larger than Pennsylvania;<i>total: </i>1,231 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Costa Rica 309 km, Honduras 922 km;910 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>natural prolongation;tropical in lowlands, cooler in highlands;extensive Atlantic coastal plains rising to central interior mountains;<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Mogoton 2,438 m;gold, silver, copper, tungsten, lead, zinc, timber, fish;<i>arable land: </i>14.57%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>1.76%<br /><i>other: </i>83.66% (2011);942.4 sq km (2003);196.6 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>1.39 cu km/yr (23%/4%/73%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>265.9 cu m/yr (2008);destructive earthquakes;deforestation;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;largest country in Central America;<i>noun: </i>Nicaraguan(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Nicaraguan;mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 69%, white 17%, black 9%, Amerindian 5%;Spanish (official) 95.3%, Miskito 2.2%, Mestizo of the Caribbean coast 2%, other 0.5%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>English and indigenous languages found on the Caribbean coast (2005 est.);Roman Catholic 58.5%, Protestant 23.2% (Evangelical 21.6%, Moravian 1.6%), Jehovah's Witnesses 0.9%, other 1.6%, none 15.7% (2005 est.);Despite being one of the poorest countries in Latin America, Nicaragua has improved its access to potable water and sanitation and has ameliorated its life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and immunization rates. However, income distribution is very uneven, and the poor, agriculturalists, and indigenous people continue to have less access to healthcare services. Nicaragua's total fertility rate has fallen from around 6 children per woman in 1980 to just above replacement level today, but the high birth rate among adolescents perpetuates a cycle of poverty and low educational attainment.<br />Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser extent the United States. Nicaraguan men have been migrating seasonally to Costa Rica to harvest bananas and coffee since the early 20th century. Political turmoil, civil war, and natural disasters from the 1970s through the 1990s dramatically increased the flow of refugees and permanent migrants seeking jobs, higher wages, and better social and healthcare benefits. Since 2000, Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica has slowed and stabilized. Today roughly 300,000 Nicaraguans are permanent residents of Costa Rica - about 75% of the foreign population - and thousands more migrate seasonally for work, many illegally.;5,848,641 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>29.3% (male 873,545/female 839,853)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>22.4% (male 657,076/female 652,856)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>38% (male 1,051,656/female 1,173,084)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>5.4% (male 147,405/female 169,618)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>4.7% (male 127,699/female 155,849) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>58.8 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>51.4 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>7.4 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>13.4 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>24.2 years<br /><i>male: </i>23.3 years<br /><i>female: </i>25.1 years (2014 est.);1.02% (2014 est.);18.41 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);5.07 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-3.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>57.5% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.94% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);MANAGUA (capital) 970,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.01 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>0.9 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.96 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.83 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.96 male(s)/female (2014 est.);95 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>20.36 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>23.36 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>17.2 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>72.72 years<br /><i>male: </i>70.57 years<br /><i>female: </i>74.98 years (2014 est.);72.4% (2006/07);1.99 children born/woman (2014 est.);10.1% of GDP (2009);0.37 physicians/1,000 population (2003);1.1 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 97.6% of population<br />rural: 67.8% of population<br />total: 85% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 2.4% of population<br />rural: 32.2% of population<br />total: 15% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 63.2% of population<br />rural: 37% of population<br />total: 52.1% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 36.8% of population<br />rural: 63% of population<br />total: 47.9% of population (2012 est.);0.3% (2012 est.);9,600 (2012 est.);100 (2012 est.);<i>degree of risk: </i>high<br /><i>food or waterborne diseases: </i>bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever<br /><i>vectorborne disease: </i>dengue fever and malaria (2013);22.2% (2008);5.7% (2007);4.6% of GDP (2010);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>78%<br /><i>male: </i>78.1%<br /><i>female: </i>77.9% (2005 est.);<i>total: </i>11 years<br /><i>male: </i>10 years<br /><i>female: </i>11 years (2002);19.7<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>median age at first birth among women 25-29 (2006-07 est.);<i>total: </i>8.6%<br /><i>male: </i>8.1%<br /><i>female: </i>9.7% (2006);;<i>total number: </i>223,992<br /><i>percentage: </i>14 %<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data represents children ages 5-17 (2005 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of Nicaragua<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Nicaragua<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republica de Nicaragua<br /><i>local short form: </i>Nicaragua;;;republic;;<i>name: </i>Managua<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>12 08 N, 86 15 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-6 (1 hour behind Washington, DC, during Standard Time);15 departments (departamentos, singular -

114;Panama;Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When the latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal. The project, which began in 2007 and could double the Canal's capacity, is expected to be completed in 2015.;;Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Colombia and Costa Rica;9 00 N, 80 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/central_america.pdf">Central America and the Caribbean</a>;<i>total: </i>75,420 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>74,340 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>1,080 sq km;slightly smaller than South Carolina;<i>total: </i>555 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Colombia 225 km, Costa Rica 330 km;2,490 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm or edge of continental margin;tropical maritime;interior mostly steep, rugged mountains and dissected, upland plains;<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Volcan Baru 3,475 m;copper, mahogany forests, shrimp, hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>7.16%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>2.51%<br /><i>other: </i>90.33% (2011);346.2 sq km (2003);148 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>0.91 cu km/yr (27%/2%/71%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>296.1 cu m/yr (2005);occasional severe storms and forest fires in the Darien area;water pollution from agricultural runoff threatens fishery resources;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Marine Life Conservation;strategic location on eastern end of isthmus forming land bridge connecting North and South America;<i>noun: </i>Panamanian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Panamanian;mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 70%, Amerindian and mixed (West Indian) 14%, white 10%, Amerindian 6%;Spanish (official), English 14%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>many Panamanians are bilingual;Roman Catholic 85%, Protestant 15%;Panama is a country of demographic and economic contrasts. It is in the midst of a demographic transition, characterized by steadily declining rates of fertility, mortality, and population growth, but disparities persist based on wealth, geography, and ethnicity. Panama has one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America and dedicates substantial funding to social programs, yet poverty and inequality remain prevalent. The indigenous population accounts for a growing share of Panama's poor and extreme poor, while the non-indigenous rural poor have been more successful at rising out of poverty through rural-to-urban labor migration. The government's large expenditures on untargeted, indirect subsidies for water, electricity, and fuel have been ineffective, but its conditional cash transfer program has shown some promise in helping to decrease extreme poverty among the indigenous population.<br />Panama has expanded access to education and clean water, but the availability of sanitation and, to a lesser extent, electricity remains poor. The increase in secondary schooling - led by female enrollment - is spreading to rural and indigenous areas, which probably will help to alleviate poverty if educational quality and the availability of skilled jobs improve.

Services include operating the Panama Canal, logistics, banking, the Colon Free Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is estimated to be completed by 2015 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 10-15% of current GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal. The United States and China are the top users of the Canal. Panama is also constructing a metro system in Panama City, valued at $1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014. Panama's booming transportation and logistics services sectors, along with aggressive infrastructure development projects, have lead the economy to continued high growth in 2012. Foreign investment, at around 10% of GDP in both 2011 and 2012, has continued to be a source of growth. Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity, as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America.

In 1898, after 400 years of colonial rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917. Popularly-elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal self government.

tourism industries. Tourism is Saint Lucia's main source of jobs and income - accounting for 65% of GDP - and the island's main source of foreign exchange earnings. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area. Crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for export, but St. Lucia's once solid banana industry has been devastated by strong competition. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks, including volatile tourism receipts, natural disasters, and dependence on foreign oil. Furthermore, high public debt - 77% of GDP in 2012 - and high debt servicing obligations constrain the ANTHONY administration's ability to respond to adverse external shocks. St. Lucia has experienced anemic growth since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, largely because of a slowdown in tourism - airlines cut back on their routes to St. Lucia in 2012. Also, St. Lucia introduced a value added tax in 2012 of 15%, becoming the last country in the Eastern Caribbean to do so. In 2013, the government introduced a National Competitiveness and Productivity Council to address St. Lucia's high public wages and lack of productivity.;$2.216 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.211 billion (2012 est.)<br />$2.23 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$1.377 billion (2013 est.);0.2% (2013 est.)<br />-0.9% (2012 est.)<br />1.8% (2011 est.);$13,100 (2013 est.)<br />$13,200 (2012 est.)<br />$13,400 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;17.4% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />18.6% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />15.3% of GDP (2013 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>60.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>19%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>31.5%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>50.3%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-61.3%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>3.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>17.4%<br /><i>services: </i>79.5% (2013 est.);bananas, coconuts, vegetables, citrus, root crops, cocoa;tourism;2.6% (2013 est.);79,700 (2012);<i>agriculture: </i>21.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>24.7%<br /><i>services: </i>53.6% (2002 est.);20% (2003 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$185.2 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$222.2 million (2011 est.);13.4% of GDP (2011 est.);-2.7% of GDP (2011 est.);77% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />77% of GDP (2010 est.);1 April - 31 March;5.3% (2013 est.)<br />4.2% (2012 est.);6.5% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />6.5% (31 December 2009 est.);9.3% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />9.5% (31 December 2012 est.);$270.3 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$259.6 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.073 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.036 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.699 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.598 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;-$210.2 million (2013 est.)<br />-$184.4 million (2012 est.);$206.8 million (2013 est.)<br />$190.1 million (2012 est.);bananas 41%, clothing, cocoa, avocados, mangoes, coconut oil;US 13.9%, UK 10.3%, Peru 9.7%, Antigua and Barbuda 9.3%, Dominica 9.1%, France 9%, Barbados 8.1%, Trinidad and Tobago 7.6%, Grenada 6.2% (2012);$592.7 million (2013 est.)<br />$579.3 million (2012 est.);food 23%, manufactured goods 21%, machinery and transportation equipment 19%, chemicals, fuels;Brazil 57.4%, US 19%, Trinidad and Tobago 9% (2012);;$446.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$438.7 million (31 December 2012 est.);;;East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -<br />2.7 (2013 est.)<br />2.7 (2012 est.)<br />2.7 (2010 est.)<br />2.7 (2009);;362 million kWh (2011 est.);332.9 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);76,000 kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);2,922 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);2,914 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);424,900 Mt (2011 est.);36,800 (2012);227,000 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>an adequate system that is automatically switched<br /><i>domestic: </i>fixed-line teledensity is 25 per 100 persons and mobile-cellular teledensity is roughly 130 per 100 persons<br /><i>international: </i>country code - 1-758;3 privately owned TV stations;.lc;100 (2012);142,900 (2009);;2 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1 (2013);;;;;<i>total: </i>1,210 km<br /><i>paved: </i>847 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>363 km (2011);;;<i>major seaport(s): </i>Castries, Cul-de-Sac, Vieux-Fort;;no regular military forces;18 years of age for voluntary security service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>41,414 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>32,688<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>36,289 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>1,574<br /><i>female: </i>1,502 (2010 est.);;;joins other Caribbean states to counter Venezuela's claim that Aves Island sustains human habitation, a criterion under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which permits Venezuela to extend its Economic Exclusion Zone/continental shelf over a large portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea;;<i>current situation: </i>St. Lucia is a destination country for persons subjected to forced prostitution and forced labor;transit point for South American drugs destined for the US and Europe
119;Saint Martin;Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 and set about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The Spanish finally relinquished Saint Martin to the French and Dutch, who divided it between themselves in 1648. Friction between the two sides caused the border to frequently fluctuate over the next two centuries, with the French eventually holding the greater portion of the island (about 57%).

Much of the workforce is employed in banana production and tourism, but persistent high unemployment has prompted many to leave the islands. This lower-middle-income country is vulnerable to natural disasters - tropical storms wiped out substantial portions of crops in 1994, 1995, and 2002. Floods and mudslides caused by unseasonable 2013 rainfall caused substantial damage to infrastructure, homes, and crops, which the World Bank estimated at US$112 million. In 2013, the islands had more than 200,000 tourist arrivals, mostly to the Grenadines. The arrival numbers represent a marginal increase from 2012 but remain 26% below St. Vincent's 2009 peak. Saint Vincent is home to a small offshore banking sector and has moved to adopt international regulatory standards. The government's ability to invest in social programs and respond to external shocks is constrained by its high public debt burden, which was 67% of GDP at the end of 2013. Weak recovery in the tourism and construction sectors will limit growth prospects in 2014.;$1.335 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.309 billion (2012 est.)<br />$1.288 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$742 million (2013 est.);2% (2013 est.)<br />1.5% (2012 est.)<br />0.4% (2011 est.);$12,100 (2013 est.)<br />$11,900 (2012 est.)<br />$11,800 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;-4.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />-6.7% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />-4.2% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>92.3%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16.6%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>23.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>21.8%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-54.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>5.4%<br /><i>industry: </i>20.3%<br /><i>services: </i>74.4% (2013 est.);bananas, coconuts, sweet potatoes, spices;tourism;3% (2013 est.);57,520 (2007 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>26%<br /><i>industry: </i>17%<br /><i>services: </i>57% (1980 est.);18.8% (2008 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$185.2 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$185.2 million (2013 est.);25% of GDP (2013 est.);0% of GDP (2013 est.);68% of GDP (2011 est.);calendar year;2.8% (2013 est.)<br />2.6% (2012 est.);6.5% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />6.5% (31 December 2009 est.);9.4% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />9.43% (31 December 2012 est.);$142.2 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$133.7 million (31 December 2012 est.);$460.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$438.5 million (31 December 2012 est.);$423.2 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$404.8 million (31 December 2012 est.);;-$207.7 million (2013 est.)<br />-$215.9 million (2012 est.);$45.7 million (2013 est.)<br />$48.7 million (2012 est.);bananas, eddoes and dasheen (taro), arrowroot starch;Trinidad and Tobago 14.5%, St. Lucia 12.9%, Turkey 12.7%, Barbados 10.7%, Dominica 8.5%, Grenada 8.1%, Antigua and Barbuda 7.3% (2012);$301.5 million (2013 est.)<br />$314.6 million (2012 est.);foodstuffs, machinery and equipment, chemicals and fertilizers, minerals and fuels;Singapore 28%, Trinidad and Tobago 22.6%, US 19%, China 5.6%, Barbados 5% (2012);$115 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$111 million (31 December 2012 est.);$255.3 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$265 million (31 December 2012 est.);;;East Caribbean dollars (XCD) per US dollar -<br />2.7 (2013 est.)<br />2.7 (2012 est.)<br />2.7 (2010 est.)<br />2.7 (2009);;136 million kWh (2010 est.);126.5 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);47,000 kW (2010 est.);85.1% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);14.9% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,948 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,474 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);198,900 Mt (2011 est.);19,400 (2012);135,500 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>adequate islandwide, fully automatic telephone system<br /><i>domestic: </i>fixed-line teledensity exceeds 20 per 100 persons and mobile-cellular teledensity exceeds 125 per 100 persons<br /><i>international: </i>country code -

122;Trinidad and Tobago;First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing.

possesses enormous fossil fuel reserves and plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals, such as uranium, copper, and zinc. It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain. In 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the former Soviet Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating. Extractive industries have been and will continue to be the engine of Kazakhstan's growth, although the country is aggressively pursuing diversification strategies. Landlocked, with restricted access to the high seas, Kazakhstan relies on its neighbors to export its products, especially oil and grain. Although its Caspian Sea ports, pipelines, and rail lines carrying oil have been upgraded, civil aviation and roadways continue to need attention. Telecoms are improving, but require considerable investment, as does the information technology base. Supply and distribution of electricity can be erratic because of regional dependencies, but the country is moving forward with plans to improve reliability of electricity and gas supply to its population. At the end of 2007, global financial markets froze up and the loss of capital inflows to Kazakhstani banks caused a credit crunch. The subsequent and sharp fall of oil and commodity prices in 2008 aggravated the economic situation, and Kazakhstan plunged into recession. While the global financial crisis took a significant toll on Kazakhstan's economy, it has rebounded well, helped by prudent government measures. Rising commodity prices have helped the recovery. Despite solid macroeconomic indicators, the government realizes that its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive industries, the so-called &quot;$243.6 billion (2013 est.)<br

126;Kyrgyzstan;A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990. Former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV overwhelmingly won the presidential election in the summer of 2005. Over the next few years, he manipulated the parliament to accrue new powers for the presidency. In July 2009, after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed. In April 2010, violent protests in Bishkek led to the collapse of the BAKIEV regime and his eventual fleeing to Minsk, Belarus. His successor, Roza OTUNBAEVA, served as transitional president until Almazbek ATAMBAEV was inaugurated in December 2011, marking the first peaceful transfer of presidential power in independent Kyrgyzstan's history. Continuing concerns include: the trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, poor interethnic relations, and terrorism.;;Central Asia, west of China, south of Kazakhstan;41 00 N, 75 00 E;<a

Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine - and on remittances from Kyrgyzstani migrant workers primarily in Russia. Following independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and exports began to increase. The overthrow of President BAKIEV in April 2010 and subsequent ethnic clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Under President ATAMBAYEV, Kyrgyzstan has developed a plan for economic development in coordination with international donors, and has also expressed its intent to join the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Progress in fighting corruption, improving transparency in licensing, business permits and taxations, restructuring domestic industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to future

127;Russia;Founded in the 12th century, the Principality of Muscovy, was able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination (13th-15th centuries) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding principalities. In the early 17th century, a new ROMANOV Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725), hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905, which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household. The communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize communism, but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics. Since then, Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state in which the leadership seeks to legitimize its rule through managed national elections, populist appeals by President PUTIN, and continued economic growth. Russia has severely disabled a Chechen rebel movement, although violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus.;;North Asia bordering the Arctic Ocean, extending from Europe (the portion west of

and globally-integrated economy, but stalling as a partially reformed, statist economy with a high concentration of wealth in officials' hands. Economic reforms in the 1990s privatized most industry, with notable exceptions in the energy and defense-related sectors. The protection of property rights is still weak and the private sector remains subject to heavy state interference. Russia is one of the world's leading producers of oil and natural gas and is also a top exporter of metals such as steel and primary aluminum. Russia's manufacturing sector is generally uncompetitive on world markets and is geared toward domestic consumption. Russia's reliance on commodity exports makes it vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the volatile swings in global prices. The economy, which had averaged 7% growth during 1998-2008 as oil prices rose rapidly, was one of the hardest hit by the 2008-09 global economic crisis as oil prices plummeted and the foreign credits that Russian banks and firms relied on dried up. Slowly declining oil prices over the past few years and difficulty attracting foreign direct investment have contributed to a noticeable slowdown in GDP growth rates. In late 2013, the Russian Economic Development Ministry reduced its growth forecast through 2030 to an average of only 2.5% per year, down from its previous forecast of 4.0 to 4.2%. In 2014, following Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, prospects for economic growth declined further, with expections that GDP growth could drop as low as zero.;$2.553 trillion (2013 est.)<br

The 1992-1997 civil war severely damaged an already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production. Because of a lack of employment opportunities in Tajikistan, more than one million Tajik citizens work abroad - roughly 90% in Russia - supporting families in Tajikistan through remittances. Less than 7% of the land area is arable and cotton is the most important crop. Until 2008, cotton production was closely monitored and controlled by the government. In the wake of the National Bank of Tajikistan's admission in December 2007 that it had directed the AgroInvestBank to improperly lend money to politically connected investors in the cotton sector, the IMF canceled its stand-by assistance program in Tajikistan. As part of the Tajik government’s subsequent reforms, over a half billion dollars in farmer debt has been forgiven. In 2008 Tajikistan passed new law authorizing farmers to decide for themselves what crops to grow, and this has resulted in a gradual decrease in cotton output. Tajikistan imports approximately 60% of its food, most of which comes by rail. Uzbekistan closed one of the rail lines into Tajikistan in late 2011, hampering the transit of goods to and from the southern part of the country. As a result, food and fuel prices increased to the highest levels since 2002. Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry consists mainly of small obsolete factories in food processing and light industry, substantial hydropower facilities, and a large aluminum plant - currently operating below 25% of capacity. Electricity output expanded with the completion of the Sangtuda-1 hydropower dam - finished in 2009 with Russian investment. The smaller Sangtuda-2 hydropower dam, built with Iranian investment, began operating in 2012 at a limited capacity. The Tajik government is tens of millions of dollars in arrears for both Sangtuda dams, and Sangtuda-2 has been closed for “maintenance” since January 2014. The government is pinning its drive for energy independence on completion of the Roghun dam, which is scheduled for mid-2014. In 2010, the government began a coerced sale of shares in the Roghun enterprise to its population, ultimately raising over $180 million before stopping under intense criticism from international donors, but the dam is likely to cost billions of dollars. The World Bank funded two feasibility studies (technical-economic, and social-environmental) for the dam. If built according to plan, Roghun will be the tallest dam in the world, will operate year around, and will significantly expand Tajikistan’s electricity output. In 2013, the Tajik government finalized an agreement to import one million tons of fuel and oil products from Russia each year, at reduced prices. Tajikistan's economic situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power shortages, and its large external debt burden.;$19.2 billion (2013 est.)<br />$17.88 billion (2012 est.)<br />$16.63 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$8.513 billion (2013 est.);7.4% (2013 est.)<br />7.5% (2012 est.)<br />7.4% (2011 est.);$2,300 (2013 est.)<br />$2,200 (2012 est.)<br />$2,100 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;12.4% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />17.8% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />10% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>97%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>12%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>14%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>6.7%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>13.7%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-48.5%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>21.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>23.2%<br /><i>services: </i>55.7% (2013 est.);cotton, grain, fruits, grapes, vegetables;aluminum, cement, vegetable oil;3.9% (2013 est.);2.209 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>46.5%<br /><i>industry: </i>10.7%<br /><i>services: </i>42.8% (2013 est.);2.5% (2013 est.)<br />2.5% (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>official rates;<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA% (2009 est.);35.6% (2013 est.);32.6 (2006)<br />34.7 (1998);<i>revenues: </i>$2.425 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.423 billion (2013 est.);28.5% of GDP (2013 est.);0% of GDP (2013 est.);6.5% of GDP<br />NA%;calendar year;3.7% (2013 est.)<br />5.8% (2012 est.);4.8% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />6.5% (31 December 2012 est.);22% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />17.13% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.044 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.191 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.033 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.555 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.611 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.196 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA<br />$NA<br />$NA;-$330 million (2013 est.)<br />-$246.2 million (2012 est.);$1.163 billion (2013 est.)<br />$826.6 million (2012 est.);aluminum, electricity, cotton, fruits, vegetable oil, textiles;Turkey 40.7%, Russia 10.6%, Iran 9.9%, Afghanistan 8.7%, China 7.4%, Kazakhstan 7.4%, Switzerland 6.6% (2012 est.);$4.121 billion (2013 est.)<br />$3.778 billion (2012 est.);petroleum products, aluminum oxide, machinery and equipment, foodstuffs;Russia 22%, Kazakhstan 15.2%, China 14.5%, Lithuania 4.7%, Kyrgyzstan 4.4%, Turkey 4.4%, Iran 4.3% (2012 est.);$1.072 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$972 million (31 December 2012 est.);$2.162 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.439 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.272 billion (31 December 2013 est.);$NA (31 December 2010 est.)<br />$16.3 billion (31 December 2009 est.);Tajikistani somoni (TJS) per US dollar -<br />4.76 (2013 est.)<br />4.76 (2012 est.)<br />4.379 (2010 est.)<br />4.1428 (2009)<br />3.4563 (2008);;17.09 billion kWh (2013 est.);16.09 billion kWh (2013 est.);1 billion kWh (2013 est.);300.5 million kWh (2012 est.);4.476 million kW (2013 est.);9% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);91% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);553 bbl/day (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2013 est.);12 million bbl (1 January 2013 est.);400 bbl/day;20,090 bbl/day (2013 est.);500 bbl/day (2013 est.);20,090 bbl/day (2013 est.);3.928 million cu m (2013 est.);3.928 million cu m (2013 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);5.663 billion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);2.618 million Mt (2013 est.);393,000 (2012);6.528 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>foreign investment in the telephone system has resulted in major improvements;state-run TV broadcaster transmits nationally on 4 stations and regionally on 4 stations;.tj;6,258 (2012);700,000 (2009);;24 (2013);<i>total: </i>17<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>2<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>4<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>5<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>3<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>3 (2013);<i>total: </i>7<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>5 (2013);;gas 549 km;<i>total: </i>680 km<br /><i>broad gauge: </i>680 km 1.520-m gauge (2008);<i>total: </i>27,767 km (2000);200 km (along Vakhsh River) (2011);;;;Ground Forces, Air and Air Defense Forces, Mobile Forces (2013);18-27 years of age for compulsory or voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>2,012,790<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>2,020,618 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,490,267<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,675,083 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>76,430<br /><i>female: </i>74,038 (2010 est.);;;in 2006, China and Tajikistan pledged to commence demarcation of the revised boundary agreed to in the delimitation of 2002;<i>stateless persons: </i>2,300 (2012);;major transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and, to a lesser extent, Western European markets
129;Turkmenistan;Present-day Turkmenistan covers territory that has been at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. The area was ruled in antiquity by various Persian empires, and was conquered by Alexander the Great, Muslim crusaders, the Mongols, Turkic warriors, and eventually the Russians. In medieval times Merv (today known as Mary) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia in the late 1800s, Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the anti-Bolshevik movement in Central Asia.

The two largest crops are cotton, most of which is produced for export, and wheat, which is domestically consumed. Although agriculture accounts for roughly 7% of GDP, it continues to employ nearly half of the country's workforce. Turkmenistan's authoritarian regime has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient and highly corrupt economy. The government introduced a privatization plan in 2012, but the implementation of this initiative has been slow. Privatization goals remain limited. From 1998-2005, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt. At the same time, however, total exports rose by an average of roughly 15% per year from 2003-08, largely because of higher international oil and gas prices. Additional pipelines to China, that began operation in early 2010, and increased pipeline capacity to Iran, have expanded Turkmenistan's export routes for its gas. Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of endemic corruption, a poor educational system, government misuse of oil and gas revenues, and Ashgabat's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms. The majority of Turkmenistan's economic statistics are state secrets. The present government established a State Agency for Statistics, but GDP numbers and other publicized figures are subject to wide margins of error. In particular, the rate of GDP growth is uncertain. Since his election, President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country's dual currency exchange rate, ordered the redenomination of the manat, reduced state subsidies for gasoline, and initiated development of a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea. Although foreign investment is encouraged, and some improvements in macroeconomic policy have been made, numerous bureaucratic obstacles impede international business activity.;$55.16 billion (2013 est.)<br />$49.18 billion (2012 est.)<br />$44.27 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$40.56 billion (2013 est.);12.2% (2013 est.)<br />11.1% (2012 est.)<br />14.7% (2011 est.);$9,700 (2013 est.)<br />$8,800 (2012 est.)<br />$8,000 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;12.6% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />12.9% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />10.6% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>50%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>12.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>11.6%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>56.4%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-30.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>7.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>24.4%<br /><i>services: </i>68.4% (2013 est.);cotton, grain, melons;natural gas, oil, petroleum products, textiles, food processing;8% (2013 est.);2.3 million (2008 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>48.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>14%<br /><i>services: </i>37.8% (2004 est.);60% (2004 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.6%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>31.7% (1998);30% (2004 est.);40.8 (1998);<i>revenues: </i>$5.93 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$5.474 billion (2013 est.);14.6% of GDP (2013 est.);1.1% of GDP (2013 est.);;calendar year;9% (2013 est.)<br />8.5% (2012 est.);;;$577.2 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$526.3 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.199 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.058 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.912 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.561 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;$285.9 million (2013 est.)<br />$622.7 million (2012 est.);$17.13 billion (2013 est.)<br />$19.99 billion (2012 est.);gas, crude oil, petrochemicals, textiles, cotton fiber;China 69.6%, Italy 4.7% (2012);$12.48 billion (2013 est.)<br />$14.14 billion (2012 est.);machinery and equipment, chemicals, foodstuffs;China 19.5%, Turkey 17%, Russia 12.6%, UAE 6.8%, Ukraine 6%, Germany 4.7%, UK 4.2% (2012);$22.35 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$20.71 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$428.9 million (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$451.5 million (31 December 2011 est.);;;Turkmen manat (TMM) per US dollar -<br />2.85 (2013 est.)<br />2.85 (2012 est.)<br />2.85 (2010 est.)<br />2.85 (2009)<br />14,250 (2008);;19.97 billion kWh (2013 est.);17.08 billion kWh (2013 est.);2.885 billion kWh (2013 est.);0 kWh (2013 est.);2.852 million kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);244,100 bbl/day (2012 est.);67,000 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);600 million bbl (1 January 2013 est.);143,200 bbl/day (2010 est.);145,000 bbl/day (2011 est.);64,360 bbl/day (2010 est.);2,542 bbl/day (2010 est.);64.4 billion cu m (2012 est.);23.3 billion cu m (2012 est.);41.1 billion cu m (2012 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);17.5 trillion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);51.85 million Mt (2011 est.);575,000 (2012);3.953 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>telecommunications network remains underdeveloped and progress toward improvement is slow;broadcast media is government controlled and censored;.tm;714 (2012);80,400 (2009);;26 (2013);<i>total: </i>21<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>9<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>9<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2 (2013);<i>total: </i>5<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>4 (2013);1 (2013);gas 7,500 km;<i>total: </i>2,980 km<br /><i>broad gauge: </i>2,980 km 1.520-m gauge (2008);<i>total: </i>58,592 km<br /><i>paved: </i>47,577 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>11,015 km (2002);1,300 km (Amu Darya and Kara Kum canal are important inland waterways) (2011);<i>total: </i>11<br /><i>by type: </i>cargo 4, chemical tanker 1, petroleum tanker 5, refrigerated cargo 1 (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Turkmenbasy;;Turkmen Armed Forces: Ground Forces, Navy, Air and Air Defense Forces (2013);18-27 years of age for compulsory male military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,380,794<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,387,211 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,066,649<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,185,538 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>53,829<br /><i>female: </i>52,988 (2010 est.);;;cotton monoculture in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan creates water-sharing difficulties for Amu Darya river states;<i>stateless persons: </i>8,947 (2012);<i>current situation: </i>Turkmenistan is a source, and to a much lesser degree, destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking;transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and Western European markets

Economic reforms have included establishing a managed float of the Burmese kyat in 2012, granting the Central Bank operational independence in July 2013, and enacting a new Anti-corruption Law in September 2013. The government’s commitment to reform, and the subsequent easing of most Western sanctions, has begun to pay dividends. The economy accelerated in 2012 and 2013. And Burma’s abundant natural resources, young labor force, and proximity to Asia’s dynamic economies have attracted foreign investment in the energy sector, garment industry, information technology, and food and beverages. Foreign direct investment grew from US$1.9 billion in FY 2011 to US$2.7 billion in FY 2012. Despite these improvements, living standards have not improved for the majority of the people residing in rural areas. Burma remains one of the poorest countries in Asia - more than one-fourth of the country’s 60 million people live in poverty. The previous government’s isolationist policies and economic mismanagement have left Burma with poor infrastructure, endemic corruption, underdeveloped human resources, and inadequate access to capital, which will require a major commitment to reverse. The Burmese government has been slow to address impediments to economic development such as an opaque revenue collection system and antiquated banking system. Key benchmarks of sustained economic progress would include modernizing and opening the financial sector, increasing budget allocations for social services, and accelerating agricultural and land reforms.;$111.1 billion (2013 est.)<br />$104 billion (2012 est.)<br />$97.81 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$59.43 billion (2013 est.);6.8% (2013 est.)<br />6.4% (2012 est.)<br />5.9% (2011 est.);$1,700 (2013 est.)<br />$1,600 (2012 est.)<br />$1,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;11.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />12.9% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />13.7% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>80.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>3.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>17.5%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.3%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>20.1%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-22.3%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>38%<br /><i>industry: </i>20.3%<br /><i>services: </i>41.7% (2013 est.);rice, pulses, beans, sesame, groundnuts, sugarcane;agricultural processing;11.4% (2013 est.);34.31 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>70%<br /><i>industry: </i>7%<br /><i>services: </i>23% (2001);5.2% (2013 est.)<br />5.4% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.8%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>32.4% (1998);32.7% (2007 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$2.413 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$4.443 billion (2013 est.);4.1% of GDP (2013 est.);-3.4% of GDP (2013 est.);;1 April -

133;Cambodia;Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863, and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal supported by international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed. In October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne and his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him. Local elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, with little of the pre-election violence that preceded prior elections. National elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful, as were commune council elections in June 2012.;;Southeastern Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, between Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos;13 00

GDP climbed more than 7% per year between 2010 and 2013. The garment industry currently employs more about 400,000 people and accounts for about 70% of Cambodia's total exports. In 2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters, representing a potential revenue stream for the government, if commercial extraction becomes feasible. Mining also is attracting some investor interest and the government has touted opportunities for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year since 2007 and reaching over 3 million visitors in 2012. Cambodia, nevertheless, remains one of the poorest countries in Asia and long-term economic development remains a daunting challenge, inhibited by endemic corruption, limited educational opportunities, high income inequality, and poor job prospects. Approximately 4 million people live on less than $1.25 per day, and 37% of Cambodian children under the age of 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition. More than 50% of the population is less than 25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the impoverished countryside, which also lacks basic infrastructure. The Cambodian Government is working with bilateral and multilateral donors, including the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's many pressing needs;$39.64 billion

134;China;For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing the rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War II, the communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s, China has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.;;Eastern Asia, bordering the East China Sea, Korea Bay, Yellow Sea, and South China

Hong Kong has no tariffs on imported goods, and it levies excise duties on only four commodities, whether imported or produced locally: hard alcohol, tobacco, hydrocarbon oil, and methyl alcohol. There are no quotas or dumping laws. Hong Kong's open economy left it exposed to the global economic slowdown that began in 2008. Although increasing integration with China, through trade, tourism, and financial links, helped it to make an initial recovery more quickly than many observers anticipated, its continued reliance on foreign trade and investment leaves it vulnerable to renewed global financial market volatility or a slowdown in the global economy.

During the global financial crisis, Indonesia outperformed its regional neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting growth. The government has promoted fiscally conservative policies, resulting in a debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 25% and historically low rates of inflation. Fitch and Moody's upgraded Indonesia's credit rating to investment grade in December 2011. Indonesia still struggles with poverty and unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among regions.

137;Japan;In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa shogunate (a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long period of relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence. For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold actual decision-making power. Following three decades of unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s, but the country remains a major economic power. In March 2011, Japan's strongest-ever earthquake, and an accompanying tsunami, devastated the northeast part of Honshu island, killing thousands and damaging several nuclear power plants. The catastrophe hobbled the country's economy and its energy infrastructure, and tested its ability to deal with humanitarian disasters.;;Eastern Asia, island chain between the North Pacific Ocean and

of high technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (1% of GDP) helped Japan develop a technologically advanced economy. Two notable characteristics of the post-war economy were the close interlocking structures of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, known as keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic demographic change. Japan's industrial sector is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. A small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. While self-sufficient in rice production, Japan imports about 60% of its food on a caloric basis. For three decades, overall real economic growth had been spectacular - a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the after effects of inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess debt, capital, and labor. Modest economic growth continued after 2000, but the economy has fallen into recession three times since 2008. A sharp downturn in business investment and global demand for Japan's exports in late 2008 pushed Japan into recession. Government stimulus spending helped the economy recover in late 2009 and 2010, but the economy contracted again in 2011 as the massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in March disrupted manufacturing. The economy has largely recovered in the two years since the disaster, but reconstruction in the Tohoku region has been uneven.

centrally directed and least open economies, faces chronic economic problems. Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of underinvestment, shortages of spare parts, and poor maintenance. Large-scale military spending draws off resources needed for investment and civilian consumption. Industrial and power output have stagnated for years at a fraction of pre-1990 levels. Frequent weather-related crop failures aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming practices, poor soil quality, insufficient fertilization, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel. Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions.

139;Korea, South;An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War. In 1910, Tokyo formally annexed the entire Peninsula. Korea regained its independence following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II, a democratic-based government (Republic of Korea, ROK) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula while a communist-style government was installed in the north (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and UN forces fought alongside ROK soldiers to defend South Korea from a DPRK invasion supported by China and the Soviet Union. A 1953 armistice split the peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. PARK Chung-hee took over leadership of the country in a 1961 coup. During his regime, from 1961 to 1979, South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. South Korea held its first free presidential election under a revised democratic constitution in 1987, with former ROK Army general ROH Tae-woo winning a close race. In 1993, KIM Young-sam (1993-98) became the first civilian president of South Korea's new democratic era. President KIM Dae-jung (1998-2003) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his contributions to South Korean democracy and his &quot;;Eastern Asia, southern half of the Korean Peninsula bordering the

In the 1960s, GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion-dollar club of world economies, and is currently the world's 12th largest economy. Initially, a system of close government and business ties, including directed credit and import restrictions, made this success possible. The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods, and encouraged savings and investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model including high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in 1999-2000. South Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis, including greater openness to foreign investment and imports. Growth moderated to about 4% annually between 2003 and 2007. South Korea's export focused economy was hit hard by the 2008 global economic downturn, but quickly rebounded in subsequent years, reaching 6.3% growth in 2010. The US-Korea Free Trade Agreement was ratified by both governments in 2011 and went into effect in March 2012. Throughout 2012 and 2013 the economy experienced sluggish growth because of market slowdowns in the United States, China, and the Eurozone. The administration in 2014 is likely to face the challenge of balancing heavy reliance on exports with developing domestic-oriented sectors, such as services. The South Korean economy's long term challenges include a rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, dominance of large conglomerates (chaebols), and heavy reliance on exports, which comprise about half of GDP.;$1.666 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$1.62 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$1.587 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$1.198 trillion (2013 est.);2.8%

140;Laos;Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, established in the 14th century under King FA NGUM. For 300 years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997 and the WTO in 2013.;;Southeastern Asia, northeast of Thailand, west of Vietnam;18 00 N, 105 00 E;<a

The results, starting from an extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008 except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Laos' growth exceeded 7% per year during 2008-13. Despite this high growth rate, Laos remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. It has a basic, but improving, road system, and limited external and internal land-line telecommunications. Electricity is available in 83 % of the country. Laos' economy is heavily dependent on capital-intensive natural resource exports. The labor force, however, still relies on agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland areas, which accounts for about 25% of GDP and 73% of total employment. Economic growth has reduced official poverty rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in 2010. The economy also has benefited from high-profile foreign direct investment in hydropower, copper and gold mining, logging, and construction though some projects in these industries have drawn criticism for their environmental impacts. Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US in 2004 and applied for Generalized System of Preferences trade benefits in 2013 after being admitted to the World Trade Organization earlier in the year. Laos is in the process of implementing a value-added tax system. Simplified investment procedures and expanded bank credits for small farmers and small entrepreneurs will improve Laos' economic prospects. The government appears committed to raising the country's profile among investors, but suffered through a fiscal crisis in 2013 brought about by public sector wage increases, fiscal mismanagement, and revenue shortfalls. The World Bank has declared that Laos' goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable, and the country is preparing to enter the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015.;$20.78 billion (2013 est.)<br />$19.18 billion (2012 est.)<br />$17.78 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$10.1 billion (2013 est.);8.3% (2013 est.)<br />7.9% (2012 est.)<br />8% (2011 est.);$3,100 (2013 est.)<br />$2,900 (2012 est.)<br />$2,700 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;27.4% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />26.2% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />25.2% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>66.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>9.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>31.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>-1.3%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>40%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-48.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>24.8%<br /><i>industry: </i>32%<br /><i>services: </i>37.5% (2013 est.);sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, tea, peanuts, rice;mining (copper, tin, gold, gypsum);11% (2013 est.);3.373 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>73.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>6.1%<br /><i>services: </i>20.6% (2012 est.);1.9% (2010 est.)<br />2.5% (2009 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.3%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>30.3% (2008);22% (2013 est.);36.7 (2008)<br />34.6 (2002);<i>revenues: </i>$2.481 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.642 billion (2013 est.);24.6% of GDP (2013 est.);-1.6% of GDP (2013 est.);46.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />49.1% of GDP (2012 est.);1 October - 30 September;6.5% (2013 est.)<br />4.3% (2012 est.);4.3% (31 December 2010)<br />4% (31 December 2009);23.2% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />22.3% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.389 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.154 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$4.071 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.673 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$4.716 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$4.034 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.012 billion (2012 est.)<br />$NA (2011);-$484.3 million (2013 est.)<br />-$315.5 million (2012 est.);$2.313 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.984 billion (2012 est.);wood products, coffee, electricity, tin, copper, gold, cassava;Thailand 34%, China 21.5%, Vietnam 12.2% (2012);$3.238 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.744 billion (2012 est.);machinery and equipment, vehicles, fuel, consumer goods;Thailand 62.1%, China 16.2%, Vietnam 7.3% (2012);$845.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$796.9 million (31 December 2012 est.);$6.69 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$6.288 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$15.14 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$12.44 billion (31 December 2011 est.);;kips (LAK) per US dollar -<br />7,875.9 (2013 est.)<br />8,007.3 (2012 est.)<br />8,258.8 (2010 est.)<br />8,516.04 (2009)<br />8,760.69 (2008);;3.629 billion kWh (2010 est.);2.4 billion kWh (2012 est.);2.537 billion kWh (2013 est.);1 billion kWh (2010 est.);3.217 million kW (2013 est.);2.6% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);97.4% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);3,391 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);3,160 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.404 million Mt (2011 est.);112,000 (2012);6.492 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>service to general public is improving;6 TV stations operating out of Vientiane - 3 government-operated and the others commercial;.la;1,532 (2012);300,000 (2009);;41 (2013);<i>total: </i>8<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>3<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>4<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>33<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>2<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>9<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>22 (2013);;refined products 540 km (2013);;<i>total: </i>39,568 km<br /><i>paved: </i>530 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>39,038 km (2007);4,600 km (primarily on the Mekong River and its tributaries;;;;Lao People's Armed Forces (LPAF): Lao People's Army (LPA;18 years of age for compulsory or voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,574,362<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,607,856 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>1,111,629<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>1,190,035 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>71,400<br /><i>female: </i>73,038 (2010 est.);NA% (2012)<br />0.23% of GDP (2011)<br />NA% (2010);serving one of the world's least developed countries, the Lao People's Armed Forces (LPAF) is small, poorly funded, and ineffectively resourced;southeast Asian states have enhanced border surveillance to check the spread of avian flu;;;estimated opium poppy cultivation in 2008 was 1,900 hectares, about a 73% increase from 2007

Administrative Region of China, &quot;;Since opening up its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in 2001, Macau has attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment, transforming the territory into one of the world's largest gaming centers. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China''s decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau. - In 2013, Macau's gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 85% of total government revenue. Macau''s economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010-13, largely on the back of tourism from mainland China and the gaming sectors. In 2013, this city of 607,500 hosted nearly 29.3 million visitors. Almost 64% came from mainland China. Macau''s traditional manufacturing industry has slowed greatly since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. China is Macau''s second largest goods export market, behind Hong Kong, and followed by the United States. In 2013, exports were US$1.1 billion, while gaming receipts were US$45.2 billion, an 18.6% increase over 2012.

Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move farther up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in Islamic finance, high technology industries, biotechnology, and services. NAJIB's Economic Transformation Program (ETP) is a series of projects and policy measures intended to accelerate the country's economic growth. The government has also taken steps to liberalize some services sub-sectors. The NAJIB administration also is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy's dependence on exports. Nevertheless, exports - particularly of electronics, oil and gas, palm oil and rubber - remain a significant driver of the economy. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices, although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel fuel, combined with sustained budget deficits, has forced Kuala Lumpur to begin to address fiscal shortfalls, through initial reductions in energy and sugar subsidies and the announcement of the 2015 implementation of a 6% goods and services tax. The government is also trying to lessen its dependence on state oil producer Petronas. The oil and gas sector supplies about 32% of government revenue in 2013. Bank Negara Malaysia (central bank) maintains healthy foreign exchange reserves, and a well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, Malaysia could be vulnerable to a fall in commodity prices or a general slowdown in global economic activity because exports are a major component of GDP. In order to attract increased investment, NAJIB earlier raised possible revisions to the special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy of 1970, but retreated in 2013 after he encountered significant opposition from Malay nationalists and other vested interests. In September 2013 NAJIB launched the new Bumiputra Economic Empowerment Program (BEEP), policies that favor and advance the economic condition of ethnic Malays.;$525 billion (2013 est.)<br />$501.5

143;Mongolia;The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest. After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states, but these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a communist regime was installed in 1924.

Mongolia's copper, gold, coal, molybdenum, fluorspar, uranium, tin, and tungsten deposits, among others, have attracted foreign direct investment. Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw Mongolia endure both deep recession, because of political inaction and natural disasters, as well as economic growth, because of reform-embracing, free-market economics and extensive privatization of the formerly state-run economy. The country opened a fledgling stock exchange in 1991. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely because of high copper prices globally and new gold production. By late 2008, Mongolia was hit hard by the global financial crisis. Slower global economic growth hurt the country's exports, notably copper, and slashed government revenues. As a result, Mongolia's real economy contracted 1.3% in 2009. In early 2009, the International Monetary Fund reached a $236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia and the country has largely emerged from the crisis with better regulations and closer supervision. The banking sector strengthened but weaknesses remain. In October 2009, Mongolia passed long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop the Oyu Tolgoi mine, considered to be among the world's largest untapped copper-gold deposits. Mongolia's ongoing dispute with a foreign investor over Oyu Tolgoi, however, has called into question the attractiveness of Mongolia as a destination for foreign direct investment. Negotiations to develop the massive Tavan Tolgoi coal field also have stalled. The economy has grown more than 10% per year since 2010, largely on the strength of commodity exports to nearby countries and high government spending domestically. Mongolia's economy, however, faces near-term economic risks from the government's loose fiscal and monetary policies, which are contributing to high inflation, and from uncertainties in foreign demand for Mongolian exports. Trade with China represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China receives more than 90% of Mongolia's exports and is Mongolia's largest supplier. Mongolia has relied on Russia for energy supplies, leaving it vulnerable to price increases;$17.03 billion (2013 est.)<br />$15.23 billion (2012 est.)<br />$13.57 billion (2011 est.)<br

NORTH (since 7 November 2012);divided diagonally from upper hoist-side corner;bird of paradise;<i>name: </i>&quot;;Papua New Guinea (PNG) is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain, land tenure issues, and the high cost of developing infrastructure. The economy has a small formal sector, focused mainly on the export of those natural resources, and an informal sector, employing the majority of the population. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the people. Mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 155 billion cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil company is constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility that could begin exporting in 2014. As the largest investment project in the country's history, it has the potential to double GDP in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export revenue. An American-owned firm also opened PNG's first oil refinery in 2004 and is building a second LNG production facility. The government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large LNG projects. In 2011 and 2012, the National Parliament passed legislation that created an offshore Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) to manage government surpluses from mineral, oil, and natural gas projects. In recent years, the government has opened up markets in telecommunications and air transport, making both more affordable to the people. Numerous challenges still face the government of Peter O'NEILL, including providing physical security for foreign investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring integrity to state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by privatizing moribund state institutions, and maintaining good relations with Australia, its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural challenges could upend the economy including chronic law and order and land tenure issues. The global financial crisis had little impact because of continued foreign demand for PNG's commodities.;$19.96 billion (2013 est.)<br />$18.93 billion (2012 est.)<br />$17.51 billion (2011 est.)<br

It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed countries. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in consumer electronics, information technology products, pharmaceuticals, and on a growing financial services sector. The economy contracted 0.6% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, but rebounded 15.1% in 2010, on the strength of renewed exports, before slowing to in 2011-13, largely a result of soft demand for exports during the second European recession.

149;Taiwan;In 1895, military defeat forced China's Qing Dynasty to cede Taiwan to Japan. Taiwan came under Chinese Nationalist control after World War II. Following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947 constitution drawn up for all of China. Beginning in the 1950s, the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the local population within the governing structure. This process expanded rapidly in the 1980s. In 2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the Nationalist (Kuomintang or KMT) to the Democratic Progressive Party.

150;Thailand;A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and later fighting alongside the United States in Vietnam. Thailand since 2005 has experienced several rounds of political turmoil including a military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat, followed by large-scale street protests by competing political factions in 2008, 2009, and 2010. THAKSIN's youngest sister, YINGLAK Chinnawat, in 2011 led the Puea Thai Party to an electoral win and assumed control of the government. A blanket amnesty bill for individuals involved in street protests, altered at the last minute to include all political crimes - including all convictions against THAKSIN - triggered months of large-scale anti-government protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013. In early May 2014 YINGLAK was removed from office and in late May 2014 the Royal Thai Army staged a coup against the caretaker government. Thailand has also experienced violence associated with the ethno-nationalist insurgency in Thailand's southern Malay-Muslim majority provinces. Since January 2004, thousands have been killed and wounded in the insurgency.;;Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, southeast of Burma;15 00 N, 100 00 E;<a

Unemployment, at less than 1% of the labor force, stands as one of the lowest levels in the world, which puts upward pressure on wages in some industries. Thailand also attracts nearly 2.5 million migrant workers from neighboring countries. The Thai government in 2013 implemented a nation-wide 300 baht ($10) per day minimum wage policy and deployed new tax reforms designed to lower rates on middle-income earners. The Thai economy has weathered internal and external economic shocks in recent years. The global economic recession severely cut Thailand's exports, with most sectors experiencing double-digit drops. In late 2011 Thailand's recovery was interrupted by historic flooding in the industrial areas in Bangkok and its five surrounding provinces, crippling the manufacturing sector. The government approved flood mitigation projects worth $11.7 billion, which were started in 2012, to prevent similar economic damage, and an additional $75 billion for infrastructure over the following seven years. This was expected to lead to an economic upsurge but growth has remained slow, in part due to ongoing political unrest and resulting uncertainties. Spending on infrastructure will require re-approval once a new government is seated.;$673 billion (2013 est.)<br />$654 billion (2012 est.)<br />$614.2 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$400.9 billion (2013 est.);2.9% (2013 est.)<br />6.5% (2012 est.)<br />0.1% (2011 est.);$9,900 (2013 est.)<br />$9,600 (2012 est.)<br />$9,100 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;30.8% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />30.5% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />28.3% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>53.5%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>13.3%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>28.2%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.9%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>70.6%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-66.6%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>12.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>43.6%<br /><i>services: </i>44.2% (2013 est.);rice, cassava (manioc, tapioca), rubber, corn, sugarcane, coconuts, soybeans;tourism, textiles and garments, agricultural processing, beverages, tobacco, cement, light manufacturing such as jewelry and electric appliances, computers and parts, integrated circuits, furniture, plastics, automobiles and automotive parts;-3.1% (2013 est.);39.38 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>38.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>13.6%<br /><i>services: </i>48.2% (2011 est.);0.7% (2013 est.)<br />0.7% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.8%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>31.5% (2009 est.);13.2% (2011 est.);39.4 (2010)<br />42 (2002);<i>revenues: </i>$80.91 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$92.9 billion (2013 est.);20.2% of GDP (2013 est.);-4% of GDP (2013 est.);45.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />45.8% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data cover general government debt, and includes debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury;1 October -

151;Timor-Leste;The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia. However, in the next three weeks, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into western Timor as refugees. Most of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999, Australian-led peacekeeping troops deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state. In 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's security when a military strike led to violence and a breakdown of law and order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste, and the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February 2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the attack, and most of the rebels surrendered in April 2008. Since the attack, the government has enjoyed one of its longest periods of post-independence stability, including successful 2012 elections for both the parliament and president. In late 2012, the UN Security Council voted to end its peacekeeping mission in Timor-Leste and both the ISF and UNMIT departed the country by the end of the year.;;Southeastern Asia, northwest of

jobs for young people entering the work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create jobs for the unemployed in part because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005, the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The Fund held assets of US$9.3 billion as of December 2011. The economy continues to recover from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest, which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity. Government spending increased markedly from 2009 through 2012, primarily on basic infrastructure, including electricity and roads. Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects. The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty. On the strength of its oil-wealth, the economy has achieved real growth between 8-12% per year for the last several years, among the highest sustained growth rates in the world.;$25.41 billion (2013 est.)<br />$23.51 billion (2012 est.)<br />$21.72 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$6.129 billion<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>non-oil GDP (2013 est.);8.1% (2013 est.)<br />8.3% (2012 est.)<br />12% (2011 est.);$21,400 (2013 est.)<br />$20,400 (2012 est.)<br />$19,400 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>16.7%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>22.3%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>16.5%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>74%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-29.5%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>2.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>81.6%<br /><i>services: </i>15.8% (2013 est.);coffee, rice, corn, cassava (manioc, tapioca), sweet potatoes, soybeans, cabbage, mangoes, bananas, vanilla;printing, soap manufacturing, handicrafts, woven cloth;6.2% (2013 est.);418,200 (2009);<i>agriculture: </i>64%<br /><i>industry: </i>10%<br /><i>services: </i>26% (2010);18.4% (2010 est.)<br />20% (2006 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>4%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>27% (2007);41% (2009 est.);31.9 (2007 est.)<br />38 (2002 est.);<i>revenues: </i>$1.6 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.7 billion (2013 est.);26.1% of GDP (2013 est.);-1.6% of GDP (2013 est.);;calendar year;4.5% (2013 est.)<br />11.8% (2012 est.);;12.3% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />12.21% (31 December 2012 est.);$203.2 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$205.8 million (31 December 2012 est.);$433.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$407 million (31 December 2012 est.);$-300 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$-681 million (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;$2.375 billion (2011 est.)<br />$1.161 billion (2007 est.);$34.1 million (2011 est.)<br />$17.8 million (2010 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>excludes oil;oil, coffee, sandalwood, marble<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>potential for vanilla exports;;$689 million (2011 est.)<br />$378 million (2010 est.);food, gasoline, kerosene, machinery;;;;;;the US dollar is used;;131.7 million kWh (2012 est.);67.59 million kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2011 est.);0 kWh (2011 est.);;;;;;79,490 bbl/day (2012 est.);87,000 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);2,755 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,264 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);200 billion cu m (1 January 2006 est.);211,100 Mt (2011 est.);3,000 (2012);621,000 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>rudimentary service in urban and some rural areas, which is expanding with the entrance of new competitors<br /><i>domestic: </i>system suffered significant damage during the violence associated with independence;1 public TV broadcast station broadcasting nationally and 1 public radio broadcaster with stations in each of the 13 administrative districts;.tl;252 (2012);2,100 (2009);;6 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>4<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>2 (2013);8 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>6,040 km<br /><i>paved: </i>2,600 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>3,440 km (2005);;<i>total: </i>1<br /><i>by type: </i>passenger/cargo 1 (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Dili;;Timor-Leste Defense Force (Falintil-Forcas de Defesa de Timor-L'este, Falintil (F-FDTL)): Army, Navy (Armada) (2013);18 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>305,643<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>293,052 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>243,120<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>251,061 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>12,737<br /><i>female: </i>12,389 (2010 est.);2.92% of GDP (2012)<br />2.6% of GDP (2011)<br />2.92% of GDP (2010);;three stretches of land borders with Timor-Leste have yet to be delimited, two of which are in the Oecussi exclave area, and no maritime or Economic Exclusion Zone boundaries have been established between the countries;;;NA
152;Vietnam;The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was completed by 1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam declared independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the communist North and anti-communist South. US economic and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the government, but US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the country experienced little economic growth because of conservative leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing international isolation.

Vietnamese authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to economic modernization in recent years. Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization in January 2007, which has promoted more competitive, export-driven industries. Vietnam became an official negotiating partner in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2010. Agriculture's share of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in 2000 to less than 20% in 2013, while industry's share increased from 36% to more than 42% in the same period. State-owned enterprises account for about 40% of GDP. Poverty has declined significantly, and Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a labor force that is growing by more than one million people every year.

154;Albania;Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939, and occupied by Germany in 1943. Communist partisans took over the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR (until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s, Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, dilapidated infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain.

Albania managed to weather the first waves of the global financial crisis but, more recently, its negative effects have put some pressure on the Albanian economy. While the government is focused on establishing a favorable business climate through the simplification of licensing requirements and tax codes, it entered into a new arrangement with the IMF for additional financial and technical support. Remittances, a significant catalyst for economic growth declined from 12-15% of GDP before the 2008 financial crisis to 7% of GDP in 2012, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy. The agricultural sector, which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming, because of a lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Complex tax codes and licensing requirements, a weak judicial system, poor enforcement of contracts and property issues, and antiquated infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business environment and makes attracting foreign investment more difficult. Inward FDI is among the lowest in the region, but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms. Albania’s energy supply has improved in recent years mostly due to upgraded transmission capacities that Albania has developed with its neighboring countries. However, technical and non-technical losses - including energy theft and non-payment - continue to be a threat to the financial viability of the entire system. Also, with help from international donors, the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth. The country will continue to face challenges from increasing public debt, having exceeded its former statutory limit of 60% of GDP in 2013. Strong trade, remittance, and banking sector ties with Greece and Italy make Albania vulnerable to spillover effects of debt crises and weak growth in the euro zone.;$28.34 billion (2013 est.)<br

Its economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand for Austrian exports and record employment growth, the international financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent global economic downturn led to a sharp but brief recession. Austrian GDP contracted 3.8% in 2009 but saw positive growth of about 2% in 2010 and 2.7% in 2011. Growth fell to 0.6% in 2012. Unemployment did not rise as steeply in Austria as elsewhere in Europe, partly because the government subsidized reduced working hour schemes to allow companies to retain employees. The 2012 unemployment rate of 4.3% was the lowest within the EU. Stabilization measures, stimulus spending, and an income tax reform pushed the budget deficit to 4.5% in 2010 and 2.6% in 2011, from only about 0.9% in 2008. The international financial crisis of 2008 caused difficulties for Austria's largest banks whose extensive operations in central, eastern, and southeastern Europe faced large losses. The government provided bank support - including in some instances, nationalization - to support aggregate demand and stabilize the banking system. Austria's fiscal position compares favorably with other euro-zone countries, but it faces external risks, such as Austrian banks' continued exposure to Central and Eastern Europe as well as political and economic uncertainties caused by the European sovereign debt crisis. In 2011 the government attempted to pass a constitutional amendment limiting public debt to 60% of GDP by 2020, but it was unable to obtain sufficient support in parliament and instead passed the measure as a simple law. In March 2012, the Austrian parliament approved an austerity package consisting of a mix of expenditure cuts and new revenues that will bring public finances into balance by 2016. In 2012, the budget deficit rose to 3.1% of GDP.;$361 billion (2013 est.)<br />$359.6 billion (2012 est.)<br />$356.5 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$417.9

157;Belarus;After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than have any of the other former Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first directly elected president, Aleksandr LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a centralized economic system.

and private-enterprise-based economy has capitalized on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the more heavily-populated region of Flanders in the north. With few natural resources, Belgium imports substantial quantities of raw materials and exports a large volume of manufactures, making its economy vulnerable to volatility in world markets. Roughly three-quarters of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries, and Belgium has benefited most from its proximity to Germany. In 2013 Belgian GDP grew by 0.1%, the unemployment rate increased to 8.8% from 7.6% the previous year, and the government reduced the budget deficit from a peak of 6% of GDP in 2009 to 3.2%. Despite the relative improvement in Belgium's budget deficit, public debt hovers around 100% of GDP, a factor that has contributed to investor perceptions that the country is increasingly vulnerable to spillover from the euro-zone crisis. Belgian banks were severely affected by the international financial crisis in 2008 with three major banks receiving capital injections from the government, and the nationalization of the Belgian retail arm of a Franco-Belgian bank.;$421.7 billion (2013 est.)<br />$421.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$422.5 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$507.4 billion

The economy relies heavily on the export of metals, energy, textiles and furniture as well as on remittances and foreign aid. A highly decentralized government hampers economic policy coordination and reform, while excessive bureaucracy and a segmented market discourage foreign investment. The interethnic warfare in Bosnia and Herzegovina caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996-99 but slowed in 2000-02 and picked up again during 2003-08, when GDP growth exceeded 5% per year. However, the country declined in 2009 reflecting local effects of the global economic crisis. GDP growth contracted again in 2012, but posted a small gain in 2013. Foreign banks, primarily from Austria and Italy, now control most of the banking sector. The konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has remained stable. Bosnia's private sector is growing slowly, but foreign investment has dropped sharply since 2007. Government spending - including transfer payments - remains high, at roughly 40% of GDP, because of redundant government offices at the state, entity and municipal level. Privatization of state enterprises has been slow, particularly in the Federation, where political division between ethnically-based political parties makes agreement on economic policy more difficult. High unemployment remains the most serious macroeconomic problem. Successful implementation of a value-added tax in 2006 provided a steady source of revenue for the government and helped rein in gray-market activity. National-level statistics have also improved over time but a large share of economic activity remains unofficial and unrecorded.

160;Bulgaria;The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime.

Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but the global downturn sharply reduced domestic demand, exports, capital inflows, and industrial production. GDP contracted by 5.5% in 2009, and has been slow to recover in the years since. Despite having a favorable investment regime, including low, flat corporate income taxes, significant challenges remain.

161;Croatia;The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands, along with a majority of Croatia's ethnic Serb population. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998.

162;Cyprus;A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the &quot;;Middle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey;35 00 N, 33 00 E;<a

Tourism, financial services, and real estate have traditionally been the most important sectors. Cyprus has been a member of the European Union (EU) since May 2004 and adopted the euro as its national currency in January 2008. During the first five years of EU membership, the Cyprus economy grew at an average rate of about 4%, with unemployment between 2004 and 2008 averaging about 3%. An overextended banking sector with excessive exposure to Greek debt resulted in a contraction in economic growth. Two of Cyprus' biggest banks were among the largest holders of Greek bonds in Europe and had a substantial presence in Greece through bank branches and subsidiaries. Following numerous downgrades of its credit rating, Cyprus lost access to international capital markets in May 2011. The economy contracted by an accumulated 8.2% between 2009 and 2013 and is not expected to return to positive growth before 2015. Unemployment is currently over 17% and expected to reach 19% in 2014.

163;Czech Republic;At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises the Czech Republic and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create &quot;;Central Europe, between Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria;49

The auto industry is the largest single industry, and, together with its upstream suppliers, accounts for nearly 24% of Czech manufacturing. The Czech Republic produced more than a million cars for the first time in 2010, over 80% of which were exported. While the conservative, inward-looking Czech financial system has remained relatively healthy, the small, open, export-driven Czech economy remains sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets, especially Germany. When Western Europe and Germany fell into recession in late 2008, demand for Czech goods plunged, leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports. As a result, real GDP fell sharply in 2009. The economy slowly recovered in the second half of 2009 and registered weak growth in the next two years. In 2012, however, the economy fell into a recession again, due both to a slump in external demand and to the government’s austerity measures. The country pulled out of recession in the second half of 2013, and most analysts expect modest, but steady, growth through 2014. Foreign and domestic businesses alike voice concerns about corruption, especially in public procurement. Other long term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, funding an unsustainable pension and health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech, services-based, knowledge economy.;$285.6 billion (2013 est.)<br />$288.2 billion (2012 est.)<br />$291.1 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$194.8

Estonia's successive governments have pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms. The current government has followed sound fiscal policies that have resulted in balanced budgets and low public debt. The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, Russia, and Germany. Estonia's economy fell into recession in mid-2008, as a result of an investment and consumption slump following the bursting of the real estate market bubble and a decrease in export demand as result of economic slowdown in the rest of Europe, but the economy has recovered strongly in the last five years. Growth was expected to top 2% in 2014, before the events in Ukraine.

167;European Union;Following the two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century, a number of European leaders in the late 1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting peace was to reconcile the two chief belligerent nations - France and Germany - both economically and politically. In 1950, the French Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all Europe, the first step of which would be the integration of the coal and steel industries of Western Europe. The following year, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six members, Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, signed the Treaty of Paris.<br />The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was made to integrate other elements of the countries' economies.

Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's trade position and its political and economic weight. Despite great differences in per capita income among member states (from $13,000 to $82,000) and in national attitudes toward issues like inflation, debt, and foreign trade, the EU has achieved a high degree of coordination of economic and fiscal policies. Eleven established EU member states, under the auspices of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), introduced the euro as their common currency on 1 January 1999 (Greece did so two years later). Between 2004 and 2007, 12 states acceded to the EU that are, in general, less advanced economically than the other 15 member states. On 1 July 2013 Croatia became the most recent member of the EU, following a decade long application process. Of the 13 most recent entrants, Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1 January 2011) and Latvia (2014) have adopted the euro;$15.85 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$15.83 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$15.89 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$16.95 trillion (2013 est.);0.1% (2013 est.)<br />-0.3% (2012 est.)<br />1.7% (2011 est.);$34,500 (2013 est.)<br />$34,500 (2012 est.)<br />$34,600 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;19.2% of GDP (2013)<br />19% of GDP (2012)<br />19.5% of GDP (2011);<i>household consumption: </i>56.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>21.6%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>17.9%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.1%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>44.9%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-42.9%<br />(2012 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.8%<br /><i>industry: </i>25.2%<br /><i>services: </i>72.8% (2013 est.);wheat, barley, oilseeds, sugar beets, wine, grapes;among the world's largest and most technologically advanced regions, the EU industrial base includes: ferrous and non-ferrous metal production and processing, metal products, petroleum, coal, cement, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, rail transportation equipment, passenger and commercial vehicles, construction equipment, industrial equipment, shipbuilding, electrical power equipment, machine tools and automated manufacturing systems, electronics and telecommunications equipment, fishing, food and beverages, furniture, paper, textiles;-0.3% (2013 est.);228.6 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>5.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>22.7%<br /><i>services: </i>72.2% (2012 est.);10.5% (2013 est.)<br />10.1% (2012);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.9%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>23.9% (2012 est.);note -

The sector normally accounts for about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the Faroese economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and historically high oil prices. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a strong performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its lowest level in June 2008 at 1.1% but gradually increased to about 5.5% in 2012. The Faroese Home Rule Government produced increasing budget surpluses in that period, which helped to reduce the large public debt, most of it to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing and salmon farming make the Faroese economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand. Initial discoveries of oil in the Faroese area give hope for eventual oil production, which may provide a foundation for a more diversified economy and less dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to about 3% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland. The Faroese Government ran relatively large deficits from 2008 to 2010 and budget deficits are forecast for several years ahead.

Trade is important, with exports accounting for over one-third of GDP in recent years. Finland is historically competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland excels in export of technology for mobile phones as well as promotion of startups in the ICT, gaming, cleantech, and biotechnology sectors. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of exports, domestic trade, and household consumption stimulated economic growth in 2010-11, however, continued recession within the EU dampened the economy in 2012-13. The recession affected general government finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget surpluses into deficits, but Finland took action to ensure it that it met the EU deficit targets in 2013 and retained its triple-A credit rating. Finland's main challenge will be to stimulate growth while faced with weak export demand in the EU and its own government austerity measures. Longer-term, Finland must address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity in traditional industries that threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.;$195.5 billion (2013 est.)<br />$196.8 billion (2012 est.)<br />$198.4 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$259.6 billion (2013 est.);-0.6% (2013 est.)<br />-0.8% (2012 est.)<br />2.7% (2011 est.);$35,900 (2013 est.)<br />$36,300 (2012 est.)<br />$36,700 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;17.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />19.6% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />21.2% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>56.3%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>24.3%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>18.3%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.3%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>38%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-37.3%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>2.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>25.1%<br /><i>services: </i>71.9% (2013 est.);barley, wheat, sugar beets, potatoes;metals and metal products, electronics, machinery and scientific instruments, shipbuilding, pulp and paper, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, clothing;-4.2% (2013 est.);2.685 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture and forestry: </i>4.4%<br /><i>industry: </i>15.5%<br /><i>construction: </i>7.1%<br /><i>commerce: </i>21.3%<br /><i>finance, insurance, and business services: </i>13.3%<br /><i>transport and communications: </i>9.9%<br /><i>public services: </i>28.5% (2011);8.1% (2013 est.)<br />7.8% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.6%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>24.7% (2007);NA%;26.8 (2008)<br />25.6 (1991);<i>revenues: </i>$139.4 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$145.3 billion<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>Central Government Budget (2013 est.);53.7% of GDP (2013 est.);-2.3% of GDP (2013 est.);56.5% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />53.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data cover general government debt, and includes debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury;calendar year;2.2% (2013 est.)<br />3.2% (2012 est.);0.75% (31 December 2013)<br />1.5% (31 December 2010)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>this is the European Central Bank's rate on the marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks in the euro area;2% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />2.06% (31 December 2012 est.);$130.8 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$126.5 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>see entry for the European Union for money supply in the euro area;$183.3 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$182.4 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$267.8 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$265.3 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$158.7 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$143.1 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$118.2 billion (31 December 2010 est.);-$2 billion (2013 est.)<br />-$3.679 billion (2012 est.);$75.7 billion (2013 est.)<br />$76.46 billion (2012 est.);electrical and optical equipment, machinery, transport equipment, paper and pulp, chemicals, basic metals;Sweden 11.1%, Russia 9.9%, Germany 9.3%, Netherlands 6.3%, US 6.2%, UK 5.1%, China 4.6% (2012);$70.67 billion (2013 est.)<br />$72.13 billion (2012 est.);foodstuffs, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, transport equipment, iron and steel, machinery, computers, electronic industry products, textile yarn and fabrics, grains;Russia 17.7%, Sweden 14.8%, Germany 13.9%, Netherlands 8.1%, China 4.4% (2012);$10.6 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$11.08 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$586.9 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$478.5 billion (31 December 2011);$138.7 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$134.4 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$197.2 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$186.7 billion (31 December 2012 est.);euros (EUR) per US dollar -<br />0.7634 (2013 est.)<br />0.7752 (2012 est.)<br />0.755 (2010 est.)<br />0.7198 (2009 est.)<br />0.6827 (2008 est.);;70.34 billion kWh (2011 est.);84.83 billion kWh (2010 est.);1.645 billion kWh (2012 est.);19.09 billion kWh (2012 est.);16.68 million kW (2010 est.);52.3% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);16.2% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);18.8% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);12.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);13,530 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);214,700 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);282,300 bbl/day (2010 est.);204,800 bbl/day (2011 est.);144,400 bbl/day (2010 est.);113,800 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);4.7 billion cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);3.661 billion cu m (2012 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);54.06 million Mt (2011 est.);890,000 (2012);9.32 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>modern system with excellent service<br /><i>domestic: </i>digital fiber-optic fixed-line network and an extensive mobile-cellular network provide domestic needs<br /><i>international: </i>country code -

170;France;France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-8, the G-20, the EU and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to take French forces out of NATO. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999.

The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. However, the government maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. With at least 82 million foreign tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that mitigate economic inequality. France's real GDP stagnated in 2012 and 2013. The unemployment rate (including overseas territories) increased from 7.8% in 2008 to 10.2% in 2013. Youth unemployment in metropolitan France decreased from a high of 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 22.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Lower-than-expected growth and high spending have strained France's public finances. The budget deficit rose sharply from 3.3% of GDP in 2008 to 7.5% of GDP in 2009 before improving to 4.1% of GDP in 2013, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to nearly 94% over the same period. In accordance with its EU obligations, France is targeting a deficit of 3.6% of GDP in 2014 and 2.8% in 2015. The administration of President Francois HOLLANDE has implemented greater state support for employment, the separation of banks' traditional deposit taking and lending activities from more speculative businesses, increasing the top corporate and personal tax rates, including a temporary 75% tax on wages over one million euros, and hiring an additional 60,000 teachers during his five-year term. In January 2014 HOLLANDE proposed a “Responsibility Pact” aimed primarily at lowering labor costs in return for businesses’ commitment to create jobs. Despite stagnant growth and fiscal challenges, France's borrowing costs have declined in recent years because investors remain attracted to the liquidity of France’s bonds.;$2.276 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$2.269 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$2.268 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$2.739 trillion (2013 est.);0.3% (2013 est.)<br />0% (2012 est.)<br />2% (2011 est.);$35,700 (2013 est.)<br />$35,800 (2012 est.)<br />$36,000 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;18.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />17.6% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />19% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>57.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>25.1%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>18.7%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.1%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>27.3%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-28.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>18.7%<br /><i>services: </i>79.4% (2013 est.);wheat, cereals, sugar beets, potatoes, wine grapes;machinery, chemicals, automobiles, metallurgy, aircraft, electronics;-0.4% (2013 est.);29.94 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>2.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>20.6%<br /><i>services: </i>76.4% (2012 est.);10.2% (2013 est.)<br />10.2% (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes overseas territories;<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.5%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>25.4% (2011);7.9% (2011);30.6 (2011)<br />27.9 (1996);<i>revenues: </i>$1.41 trillion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.522 trillion (2013 est.);51.5% of GDP (2013 est.);-4.1% of GDP (2013 est.);93.4% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />90.2% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data cover general government debt, and includes debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury;calendar year;0.9% (2013 est.)<br />2% (2012 est.);0.75% (31 December 2013)<br />1.75% (31 December 2010)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>this is the European Central Bank's rate on the marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks in the euro area;3.1% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />3.44% (31 December 2012 est.);$810.1 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$738.8 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>see entry for the European Union for money supply in the euro area;$2.299 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.273 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);$3.687 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.631 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.762 trillion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$1.538 trillion (31 December 2011)<br />$1.983 trillion (31 December 2010 est.);-$58.97 billion (2013 est.)<br />-$45.22 billion (2012 est.);$578.6 billion (2013 est.)<br />$567.1 billion (2012 est.);machinery and transportation equipment, aircraft, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceutical products, iron and steel, beverages;Germany 16.7%, Belgium 7.5%, Italy 7.5%, Spain 6.9%, UK 6.9%, US 5.6%, Netherlands 4.3% (2012);$659.8 billion (2013 est.)<br />$653.4 billion (2012 est.);machinery and equipment, vehicles, crude oil, aircraft, plastics, chemicals;Germany 19.5%, Belgium 11.3%, Italy 7.6%, Netherlands 7.4%, Spain 6.6%, UK 5.1%, China 4.9% (2012);$198.7 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$188.4 billion (31 December 2011 est.);$5.371 trillion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$5.004 trillion (31 December 2011);$1.103 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.095 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.489 trillion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.497 trillion (31 December 2012 est.);euros (EUR) per US dollar -<br />0.7634 (2013 est.)<br />0.7752 (2012 est.)<br />0.755 (2010 est.)<br />0.7198 (2009 est.)<br />0.6827 (2008 est.);;561.2 billion kWh (2012 est.);462.9 billion kWh (2012 est.);73.4 billion kWh (2012 est.);29 billion kWh (2012 est.);124.3 million kW (2010 est.);22.1% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);50.8% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);14.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);6.9% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);72,300 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1.298 million bbl/day (2010 est.);85.18 million bbl (1 January 2013 est.);1.55 million bbl/day (2010 est.);1.792 million bbl/day (2011 est.);464,300 bbl/day (2010 est.);834,800 bbl/day (2010 est.);508 million cu m (2012 est.);47.99 billion cu m (2010 est.);5.994 billion cu m (2012 est.);47.71 billion cu m (2012 est.);10.7 billion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);374.3 million Mt (2011 est.);39.29 million (2012);62.28 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>highly developed<br /><i>domestic: </i>extensive cable and microwave radio relay;a mix of both publicly operated and privately owned TV stations;metropolitan France -

171;Germany;As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which became the EU, and NATO, while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.;;Central Europe, bordering the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, between the Netherlands and

Like its Western European neighbors, Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms. Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth, has contributed to strong growth and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 5.3% in 2013. The new German government introduced a minimum wage of $11 per hour to take effect in 2015. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second term increased Germany's total budget deficit - including federal, state, and municipal - to 4.1% in 2010, but slower spending and higher tax revenues reduced the deficit to 0.8% in 2011 and in 2012 Germany reached a budget surplus of 0.1%. A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016 though the target was already reached in 2012. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Chancellor Angela MERKEL announced in May 2011 that eight of the country's 17 nuclear reactors would be shut down immediately and the remaining plants would close by 2022. Germany hopes to replace nuclear power with renewable energy. Before the shutdown of the eight reactors, Germany relied on nuclear power for 23% of its electricity generating capacity and 46% of its base-load electricity production.;$3.227 trillion (2013

Tourism provides 18% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek economy averaged growth of about 4% per year between 2003 and 2007, but the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a growing budget deficit. By 2013 the economy had contracted 26%, compared with the pre-crisis level of 2007. Greece met the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than 3% of GDP in 2007-08, but violated it in 2009, with the deficit reaching 15% of GDP. Austerity measures have reduced the deficit to about 4% in 2013, including government debt payments. Deteriorating public finances, inaccurate and misreported statistics, and consistent underperformance on reforms prompted major credit rating agencies to downgrade Greece's international debt rating in late 2009, and led the country into a financial crisis. Under intense pressure from the EU and international market participants, the government adopted a medium-term austerity program that includes cutting government spending, decreasing tax evasion, overhauling the health-care and pension systems, and reforming the labor and product markets. Athens, however, faces long-term challenges to continue pushing through unpopular reforms in the face of widespread unrest from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public. In April 2010 a leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit rating;$267.1 billion (2013 est.)<br />$277.7 billion (2012 est.)<br />$296.6 billion (2011 est.)<br

177;Iceland;Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world standards.;;Northern Europe, island between the Greenland Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the United Kingdom;65 00 N, 18

Prior to the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 40% of export earnings, more than 12% of GDP, and employs nearly 5% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of software production, biotechnology, and tourism. In fall 2013, the Icelandic government approved a joint application by Icelandic, Chinese and Norwegian energy firms to conduct oil exploration off Iceland’s northeast coast. Abundant geothermal and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment in the aluminum sector, boosted economic growth, and sparked some interest from high-tech firms looking to establish data centers using cheap green energy, although the financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in foreign currencies, following the privatization of the banking sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic banks, whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks collapsed in late 2008. The country secured over $10 billion in loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and financial sector, and to back government guarantees for foreign deposits in Icelandic banks. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. Since the collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic priorities have included: stabilizing the krona, implementing capital controls, reducing Iceland's high budget deficit, containing inflation, addressing high household debt, restructuring the financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Three new banks were established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks. Two of them have foreign majority ownership, while the State holds a majority of the shares of the third. Iceland began making payments to the UK, the Netherlands, and other claimants in late 2011 following Iceland's Supreme Court ruling that upheld 2008 emergency legislation that gives priority to depositors for compensation from failed Icelandic banks.

178;Ireland;Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600 and 150 B.C. Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014. Norman invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh repressions. The Irish famine of the mid-19th century saw the population of the island drop by one third through starvation and emigration. For more than a century after that the population of the island continued to fall only to begin growing again in the 1960s. Over the last 50 years, Ireland's high birthrate has made it demographically one of the youngest populations in the EU.

Ireland was among the initial group of 12 EU nations that began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002. GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has dropped sharply since the onset of the world financial crisis. Ireland entered into a recession in 2008 for the first time in more than a decade, with the subsequent collapse of its domestic property market and construction industry. Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to 2007 than in any other developed economy. Since their 2007 peak, average house prices have fallen 47%. In the wake of the collapse of the construction sector and the downturn in consumer spending and business investment, the export sector, dominated by foreign multinationals, has become an even more important component of Ireland's economy. Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry and services. In 2008 the former COWEN government moved to guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the banking system, and establish partly-public venture capital funds in response to the country's economic downturn. In 2009, in continued efforts to stabilize the banking sector, the Irish Government established the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem commercial property and development loans from Irish banks. Faced with sharply reduced revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the Irish Government introduced the first in a series of draconian budgets in 2009. In addition to across-the-board cuts in spending, the 2009 budget included wage reductions for all public servants. These measures were not sufficient to stabilize Ireland’s public finances. In 2010, the budget deficit reached 32.4% of GDP - the world's largest deficit, as a percentage of GDP - because of additional government support for the country’s deeply troubled banking sector. In late 2010, the former COWEN government agreed to a $92 billion loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin recapitalize Ireland’s fragile banking sector and avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt. Since entering office in March 2011, the new KENNY government has intensified austerity measures to try to meet the deficit targets under Ireland's EU-IMF program. Ireland has grown slowly since 2011, but managed to reduce the budget deficit to 7.2% of GDP in 2013. In late 2013, Ireland formally exited its EU-IMF bailout program, benefiting from its strict adherence to deficit-reduction targets and success in refinancing a large amount of banking-related debt.;$190.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$189.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$189 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$220.9 billion (2013 est.);0.6% (2013 est.)<br

180;Italy;Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous

PHILLIPS (since 16 August 2013);three equal vertical bands of green (hoist side), white, and red;white, five-pointed star (Stella d'Italia);<i>name: </i>&quot;;Italy has a diversified industrial economy, which is divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less-developed, highly subsidized, agricultural south, where unemployment is higher. The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them family-owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro-zone, but its exceptionally high public debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it vulnerable to scrutiny by financial markets. Public debt has increased steadily since 2007, topping 133% of GDP in 2013, but investor concerns about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased in 2013, bringing down Italy's borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era records. The government still faces pressure from investors and European partners to sustain its efforts to address Italy's long-standing structural impediments to growth, such as labor market inefficiencies and widespread tax evasion.

All raw material and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a popular tax haven.

183;Kosovo;The central Balkans were part of the Roman and Byzantine Empires before ethnic Serbs migrated to the territories of modern Kosovo in the 7th century. During the medieval period, Kosovo became the center of a Serbian Empire and saw the construction of many important Serb religious sites, including many architecturally significant Serbian Orthodox monasteries. The defeat of Serbian forces at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five centuries of Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and Albanians moved to Kosovo. By the end of the 19th century, Albanians replaced the Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia reacquired control over Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War of 1912. After World War II, Kosovo became an autonomous province of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (S.F.R.Y.) with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the 1974 S.F.R.Y. constitution. Despite legislative concessions, Albanian nationalism increased in the 1980s, which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's independence. At the same time, Serb nationalist leaders, such as Slobodan MILOSEVIC, exploited Kosovo Serb claims of maltreatment to secure votes from supporters, many of whom viewed Kosovo as their cultural heartland. Under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia instituted a new constitution in 1989 that revoked Kosovo's status as an autonomous province of Serbia. Kosovo's Albanian leaders responded in 1991 by organizing a referendum that declared Kosovo independent. Under MILOSEVIC, Serbia carried out repressive measures against the Kosovar Albanians in the early 1990s as the unofficial Kosovo government, led by Ibrahim RUGOVA, used passive resistance in an attempt to try to gain international assistance and recognition of an independent Kosovo. Albanians dissatisfied with RUGOVA's passive strategy in the 1990s created the Kosovo Liberation Army and launched an insurgency. Starting in 1998, Serbian military, police, and paramilitary forces under MILOSEVIC conducted a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians. Approximately 800,000 ethnic Albanians were forced from their homes in Kosovo during this time. International attempts to mediate the conflict failed, and MILOSEVIC's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month NATO military operation against Serbia beginning in March 1999 that forced Serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces from Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed Kosovo under a transitional administration, the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's final status. The negotiations ran in stages between 2006 and 2007, but ended without agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Since then, over 100 countries have recognized Kosovo, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Council of Europe Development Bank, and signed a framework agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB). In October 2008, Serbia sought an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality under international law of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The ICJ released the advisory opinion in July 2010 affirming that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate general principles of international law, UN Security Council Resolution 1244, or the Constitutive Framework. The opinion was closely tailored to Kosovo's unique history and circumstances. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence, but the two countries reached an agreement to normalize their relations in April 2013 through EU-facilitated talks and are currently engaged in the implementation process.;;Southeast Europe, between Serbia and Macedonia;42 35 N, 21 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/europe.pdf">Europe</a>;<i>total: </i>10,887 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>10,887 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km;slightly larger than Delaware;<i>total: </i>702 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Albania 112 km, Macedonia 159 km, Montenegro 79 km, Serbia 352 km;0 km (landlocked);none (landlocked);influenced by continental air masses resulting in relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall and hot, dry summers and autumns;flat fluvial basin with an elevation of 400-700 m above sea level surrounded by several high mountain ranges with elevations of 2,000 to 2,500 m;<i>lowest point: </i>Drini i Bardhe/Beli Drim 297 m (located on the border with Albania)<br /><i>highest point: </i>Gjeravica/Deravica 2,656 m;nickel, lead, zinc, magnesium, lignite, kaolin, chrome, bauxite;;;;;;;;;<i>noun: </i>Kosovar (Albanian), Kosovac (Serbian)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Kosovar (Albanian), Kosovski (Serbian)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>Kosovan, a neutral term, is sometimes also used as a noun or adjective;Albanians 92%, other (Serb, Bosniak, Gorani, Roma, Turk, Ashkali, Egyptian) 8% (2008);Albanian (official), Serbian (official), Bosnian, Turkish, Roma;Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Roman Catholic;;1,859,203 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>26.3% (male 253,876/female 234,810)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>18.1% (male 176,738/female 159,455)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>41.5% (male 407,347/female 365,029)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>7.2% (male 65,762/female 67,243)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>6.9% (male 54,059/female 74,884) (2014 est.);;<i>total: </i>27.8 years<br /><i>male: </i>27.4 years<br /><i>female: </i>28.2 years (2014 est.);;;;;;;<i>at birth: </i>1.08 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.08 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.11 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1.12 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>1.06 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.73 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>1.06 male(s)/female (2014 est.);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;4.3% of GDP (2008);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>91.9%<br /><i>male: </i>96.6%<br /><i>female: </i>87.5% (2007 Census);;;<i>total: </i>55.3%<br /><i>male: </i>52%<br /><i>female: </i>63.8% (2012);;;<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of Kosovo<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Kosovo<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republika e Kosoves (Republika Kosovo)<br /><i>local short form: </i>Kosova (Kosovo);;;republic;;<i>name: </i>Pristina (Prishtine, Prishtina)<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>42 40 N, 21 10 E<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>+1hr, begins last Sunday in March;37 municipalities (komunat, singular -

Kosovo's citizens are the poorest in Europe with a per capita GDP (PPP) of $7,600 in 2013. An unemployment rate of 45% encourages emigration and fuels a significant informal, unreported economy. Remittances from the diaspora - located mainly in Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries - are estimated to account for about 15% of GDP, and donor-financed activities and aid for approximately 10%. Most of Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital, Pristina. Inefficient, near-subsistence farming is common - the result of small plots, limited mechanization, and lack of technical expertise. With international assistance, Kosovo has been able to privatize a majority of its state-owned-enterprises. Minerals and metals - including lignite, lead, zinc, nickel, chrome, aluminum, magnesium, and a wide variety of construction materials - once formed the backbone of industry, but output has declined because of ageing equipment and insufficient investment. A limited and unreliable electricity supply due to technical and financial problems is a major impediment to economic development, but Kosovo has received technical assistance to help improve accounting and controls and, in 2012, privatized its distribution network. The US Government is cooperating with the Ministry for Energy and Mines and the World Bank to prepare commercial tenders for the construction of a new power plant, rehabilitation of an old plant, and the development of a coal mine that could supply both. In July 2008, Kosovo received pledges of $1.9 billion from 37 countries in support of its reform priorities, but the global financial crisis has limited this assistance and also negatively affected remittance inflows. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and Kosovo began servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic structures, UNMIK signed (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA) in 2006. Serbia and Bosnia previously had refused to recognize Kosovo's customs stamp or extend reduced tariff privileges for Kosovo products under CEFTA, but both countries resumed trade with Kosovo in 2011. The official currency of Kosovo is the euro, but the Serbian dinar is also used illegally in Serb enclaves. Kosovo's tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo maintained a budget surplus until 2011, when government expenditures climbed sharply. In 2013 Kosovo signed a Free Trade Agreement with Turkey and is negotiating liberalization of trade with EU as part of a Stabilization and Association Agreement.;$14.11 billion (2013 est.)<br />$13.77 billion (2012 est.)<br />$13.43 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$7.15 billion (2013 est.);2.5% (2013 est.)<br />2.5% (2012 est.)<br />4.4% (2011 est.);$7,600 (2013 est.)<br />$7,500 (2012 est.)<br />$7,400 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;12.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />12.5% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />12.4% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>90.5%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>28.2%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>3%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>18.8%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-53.9%<br />(2012 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>12.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>22.6%<br /><i>services: </i>64.5% (2009 est.);wheat, corn, berries, potatoes, peppers, fruit;mineral mining, construction materials, base metals, leather, machinery, appliances, foodstuffs and beverages, textiles;;800,000<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes those estimated to be employed in the grey economy (2011 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>23.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>NA%<br /><i>services: </i>NA% (2010);30.9% (2013 est.)<br />45% (1)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>Kosovo has a large informal sector that may not be reflected in these data;;30% (2013 est.);30 (FY05/06);<i>revenues: </i>$1.916 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$2.048 billion (2013 est.);26.8% of GDP (2013 est.);-1.8% of GDP (2013 est.);9.1% of GDP (2013)<br />8.4% of GDP (2012);;1.8% (2013 est.)<br />2.5% (2012 est.);;NA% (30 June 2013 est.)<br />13.7% (31 December 2012 est.);;$2.773 billion<br />$2.637 billion;$2.505 billion<br />$2.445 billion;;-$919.7 million (2013 est.)<br />-$1.083 billion (2012 est.);$408 million (2013 est.)<br />$382.8 million (2012 est.);mining and processed metal products, scrap metals, leather products, machinery, appliances, prepared foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco, vegetable products, textile and textile articles;Italy 25.8%, Albania 14.6%, Macedonia 9.6%, China 5.5%, Gernamy 5.4%, Switzerland 5.4%, Turkey 4.1% (2012 est.);$3.398 billion (2013 est.)<br />$3.477 billion (2012 est.);foodstuffs, livestock, wood, petroleum, chemicals, machinery, minerals, textiles, stone, ceramic and glass products, electrical equipment;Germany 11.9%, Macedonia 11.5%, Serbia 11.1%, Italy 8.5%, Turkey 9%, China 6.4%, Albania 4.4% (2012 est.);$NA;$448.2 million (2013 est.)<br />$466 million (2012 est.);$21.2 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$25.8 million (31 December 2012 est.);;euros (EUR) per US dollar -<br />0.7634 (2013 est.)<br />0.7752 (2012 est.)<br />0.755 (2010 est.)<br />0.7198 (2009 est.)<br />0.6827 (2008 est.);;5.847 billion kWh (2012);5.467 billion kWh (2012);371.3 million kWh;625.1 million kWh;1.526 million kW;;;;;;;;NA bbl;0 bbl/day (2007);NA bbl/day (2011 est.);;;0 cu m (2007);0 cu m (2007);;;NA cu m;;106,300 (2006);562,000 (2007);;;;;;;6 (2013);<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>3<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>3 (2013);2 (2013);;<i>total: </i>430 km<br /><i>standard gauge: </i>430 km 1.435-m gauge (2007);<i>total: </i>6,955 km<br /><i>paved: </i>1,843 km (includes 38 km of expessways)<br /><i>unpaved: </i>5,112 km (2012);;;;;Kosovo Security Force (FSK) (2010);;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>430,926<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>389,614 (2010 est.);;;;Serbia with several other states protest the US and other states' recognition of Kosovo's declaration of its status as a sovereign and independent state in February 2008;<i>IDPs: </i>17,300 (primarily ethnic Serbs displaced during the 1998-1999 war fearing reprisals from the majority ethnic-Albanian population;;

Due to its geographical location, transit services are highly-developed, along with timber and wood-processing, agriculture and food products, and manufacturing of machinery and electronics industries. Corruption continues to be an impediment to attracting foreign direct investment and Latvia's low birth rate and decreasing population are major challenges to its long-term economic vitality. Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per year during 2006-07, but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy. Triggered by the collapse of the second largest bank, GDP plunged 18% in 2009. The economy has not returned to pre-crisis levels despite strong growth, especially in the export sector in 2011-12. The IMF, EU, and other international donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the currency's peg to the euro in exchange for the government's commitment to stringent austerity measures. The IMF/EU program successfully concluded in December 2011. The government of Prime Minister Valdis DOMBROVSKIS remains committed to fiscal prudence and reducing the fiscal deficit. The majority of companies, banks, and real estate have been privatized, although the state still holds sizable stakes in a few large enterprises, including 99.8% ownership of the Latvian national airline. Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization in February 1999 and the EU in May 2004.

185;Liechtenstein;The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.;;Central Europe, between Austria and Switzerland;47 16 N, 9 32 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/europe.pdf">Europe</a>;<i>total: </i>160 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>160 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km;about 0.9 times the size of Washington, DC;<i>total: </i>76 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Austria 34.9 km, Switzerland 41.1 km;0 km (doubly landlocked);none (landlocked);continental;mostly mountainous (Alps) with Rhine Valley in western third;<i>lowest point: </i>Ruggeller Riet 430 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Vorder-Grauspitz 2,599 m;hydroelectric potential, arable land;<i>arable land: </i>21.88%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0%<br /><i>other: </i>78.12% (2011);NA;;;NA;NA;<i>party to: </i>Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Law of the Sea;along with Uzbekistan, one of only two doubly landlocked countries in the world;<i>noun: </i>Liechtensteiner(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Liechtenstein;Liechtensteiner 65.6%, other 34.4% (2000 census);German 94.5% (official) (Alemannic is the main dialect), Italian 1.1%, other 4.3% (2010 est.);Roman Catholic (official) 75.9%, Protestant Reformed 6.5%, Muslim 5.4%, Lutheran 1.3%, other 2.9%, none 5.4%, unspecified 2.6% (2010 est.);;37,313 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>15.7% (male 3,130/female 2,744)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>11.7% (male 2,160/female 2,197)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>43.1% (male 8,029/female 8,069)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>13.4% (male 2,479/female 2,535)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>15.4% (male 2,713/female 3,257) (2014 est.);;<i>total: </i>42.4 years<br /><i>male: </i>41.3 years<br /><i>female: </i>43.5 years (2014 est.);0.82% (2014 est.);10.53 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);7.02 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);4.72 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>14.4% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>0.53% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);VADUZ (capital) 5,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.26 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.14 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>0.98 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.99 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.81 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.98 male(s)/female (2014 est.);;<i>total: </i>4.33 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>4.62 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>3.96 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>81.68 years<br /><i>male: </i>79.52 years<br /><i>female: </i>84.4 years (2014 est.);;1.69 children born/woman (2014 est.);;;;;;NA;NA;NA;;;;2.1% of GDP (2008);<i>definition: </i>age 10 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>100%<br /><i>male: </i>100%<br /><i>female: </i>100%;<i>total: </i>15 years<br /><i>male: </i>16 years<br /><i>female: </i>14 years (2011);;;;;<i>conventional long form: </i>Principality of Liechtenstein<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Liechtenstein<br /><i>local long form: </i>Fuerstentum Liechtenstein<br /><i>local short form: </i>Liechtenstein;;;hereditary constitutional monarchy;;<i>name: </i>Vaduz<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>47 08 N, 9 31 E<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>+1hr, begins last Sunday in March;11 communes (Gemeinden, singular -

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Since 2008, Liechtenstein has faced renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US.

Despite its EU accession, Lithuania's trade with its Central and Eastern European neighbors, and Russia in particular, accounts for a significant share of total trade. Foreign investment and business support have helped in the transition from the old command economy to a market economy. The three former Soviet Baltic republics were among the hardest hit by the 2008-09 financial crisis. The government's efforts to attract foreign investment, to develop export markets, and to pursue broad economic reforms has been key to Lithuania's quick recovery from a deep recession, making Lithuania one of the fastest growing economies in the EU. Lithuania is committed to meeting the Maastricht criteria to join the euro zone, which the government expects to achieve by 2015. Under the Conservative Party's leadership, Lithuania raised the monthly minimum wage in January 2012 nearly 25% over 2011. In January 2013, the new Social Democrat-led government increased the minimum wage another 25% over January 2012.

187;Luxembourg;Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half of its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.

Most banks are foreign-owned and have extensive foreign dealings, but Luxembourg has lost some of its advantages as a favorable tax location because of OECD and EU pressure. The economy depends on foreign and cross-border workers for about 40% of its labor force. Luxembourg, like all EU members, suffered from the global economic crisis that began in late 2008, but unemployment has trended below the EU average. Following strong expansion from 2004 to 2007, Luxembourg's economy contracted 3.6% in 2009, but rebounded in 2010-11 before slowing again in 2012. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high standard of living - GDP per capita ranks among the highest in the world, and is the highest in the euro zone. Turmoil in the world financial markets and lower global demand during 2008-09 prompted the government to inject capital into the banking sector and implement stimulus measures to boost the economy. Government stimulus measures and support for the banking sector, however, led to a 5% government budget deficit in 2009. Nevertheless, the deficit was cut to 1.1% in 2011 and 0.9% in 2012. Even during the financial crisis and recovery, Luxembourg retained the highest current account surplus as a share of GDP in the euro zone, owing largely to their strength in financial services. Public debt remains among the lowest of the region although it has more than doubled since 2007 as percentage of GDP. Luxembourg's economy, while stabile, grew slowly in 2012 due to ongoing weak growth in the euro area. Authorities have strengthened supervision of domestic banks because of their exposure to the activities of foreign banks.;$42.67 billion (2013 est.)<br />$42.44 billion (2012 est.)<br />$42.3 billion

Unemployment has remained consistently high at more than 30% since 2008, but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market, estimated to be between 20% and 45% of GDP, that is not captured by official statistics. Macedonia’s economy is closely linked to Europe as a customer for exports and source of investment, and has suffered as a result of prolonged weakness in the euro zone. Macedonia maintained macroeconomic stability through the global financial crisis by conducting prudent monetary policy, which keeps the domestic currency pegged against the euro, and by limiting fiscal deficits.

Malta's geographic position between Europe and North Africa makes it a target for irregular migration, which has strained Malta's political and economic resources. Malta's fertility rate is below the EU average, and population growth in recent years has largely been from immigration, putting increasing pressure on the pension system. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. Malta's economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, and tourism, and was hurt by the global economic downturn, but fared better than most other EU member states. Malta has low unemployment relative to other European countries, and growth has recovered since the 2009 recession. Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and it has avoided contagion from the European financial crisis, largely because its debt is mostly held domestically and its banks have low exposure to the sovereign debt of peripheral European countries. The EU reopened an excessive deficit procedure against Malta in June 2013, having found that its forecasted deficit for the year was likely to exceed 3% of GDP.;$11.22 billion (2013 est.)<br />$10.96 billion (2012 est.)<br />$10.89 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$9.541 billion (2013 est.);2.4% (2013 est.)<br />0.6% (2012 est.)<br />1.6% (2011 est.);$29,200 (2012 est.)<br />$28,800 (2011 est.)<br />$28,300 (2010 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2012 US dollars;13.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />13.5% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />12.8% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>56.8%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>20.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>14.5%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>-0.5%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>92%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-86.4%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.4%<br /><i>industry: </i>25.3%<br /><i>services: </i>73.3% (2013 est.);potatoes, cauliflower, grapes, wheat, barley, tomatoes, citrus, cut flowers, green peppers;tourism, electronics, ship building and repair, construction, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, footwear, clothing, tobacco, aviation services, financial services, information technology services;-6.9% (2013);190,400 (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.4%<br /><i>industry: </i>22.2%<br /><i>services: </i>76.4% (2013);6.4% (2013 est.)<br />6.5% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;15.1% (2012);27.1 (2012)<br />26 (2007);<i>revenues: </i>$4.843 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$4.322 billion (2013 est.);50.8% of GDP (2013 est.);5.5% of GDP (2013 est.);75.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />70.8% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>Malta reports public debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of the year, according to guidelines set out in the Maastricht Treaty for general government gross debt;calendar year;1% (2013 est.)<br />3.2% (2012 est.);0.75% (31 December 2013)<br />1.5% (31 December 2010)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>this is the European Central Bank's rate on the marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks in the euro area;0.25% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />0.75% (31 December 2012 est.);$8.932 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$7.892 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>see entry for the European Union for money supply in the euro area;$15.44 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$13.88 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$19.16 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$20.72 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$3.631 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$3.424 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$2.399 billion (31 December 2010 est.);$133.1 million (2013 est.)<br />$181.5 million (2012 est.);$5.105 billion (2013 est.)<br />$5.893 billion (2012 est.);machinery and mechanical appliances;Germany 8.9%, Singapore 7.1%, Libya 6.2%, France 6.2%, United States 4.4% (2013 est.);$7.436 billion (2013 est.)<br />$8.209 billion (2012 est.);mineral fuels, oils and products;Italy 24.6%, Germany 5.6%, United Kingdom 5.4%, Russia 5.1%, France 5% (2013 est.);$377 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$481.5 million (31 December 2012 est.);$51.08 billion (30 September 2013 est.)<br />$46.72 billion (31 December 2012);$15.17 billion (31 June 2013)<br />$16.4 billion (31 December 2012);$1.442 billion (31 June 2013 est.)<br />$1.471 billion (31 December 2012);euros (EUR) per US dollar -<br />0.7634 (2013 est.)<br />0.7752 (2012 est.)<br />0.755 (2010 est.)<br />0.7198 (2009 est.)<br />0.6827 (2008 est.);;2.221 billion kWh (2013);2.211 billion kWh (2013 est.);0 kWh (2013 est.);0 kWh (2013 est.);530,000 kW (2013 est.);97.5% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);2.5% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2013 est.);0 bbl;0 bbl/day (2013 est.);19,520 bbl/day (2011 est.);14,410 bbl/day (2013 est.);36,480 bbl/day (2013 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);0 cu m (2013 est.);0 cu m (July 5, 1905 est.);2.682 million Mt (2011 est.);229,700 (2012);539,500 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>automatic system featuring submarine cable and microwave radio relay between islands<br /><i>domestic: </i>combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular subscribership exceeds 180 per 100 persons<br /><i>international: </i>country code -

One of the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as its president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until he resigned in September 2009, following the opposition's gain of a narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist Party's (PCRM) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of parliamentary votes required to elect a president and, by doing so, put into place a permanent government. Four Moldovan opposition parties formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European Integration (AEI), iterations of which have acted as Moldova's governing coalitions since. Moldova experienced significant political uncertainty between 2009 and early 2012, holding three general elections and numerous presidential ballots in parliament, all of which failed to secure a president. Following November 2010 parliamentary elections, a reconstituted AEI-coalition consisting of three of the four original AEI parties formed a government, and in March 2012 was finally able to elect an independent as president. As of late May 2013, the ruling coalition - comprised of two of the original AEI parties and a splinter group from a third - is called the Pro-European Coalition. In November 2013, the Moldovan Government initialed an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), advancing the coalition's policy priority of EU integration.;;Eastern Europe, northeast of

With a moderate climate and good farmland, Moldova's economy relies heavily on its agriculture sector, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova also depends on annual remittances of about $1.6 billion from the roughly one million Moldovans working in Europe, Russia, and other former Soviet Bloc countries. With few natural energy resources, Moldova imports almost all of its energy supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy is underscored by a growing $5 billion debt to Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom, largely the result of unreimbursed natural gas consumption in the separatist Transnistria region. In August 2013, work began on a new pipeline between Moldova and Romania that may eventually break Russia's monopoly on Moldova's gas supplies. The government's goal of EU integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2013 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences. Moldova is poised to sign an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU during fall 2014, connecting Moldovan products to the world’s largest market. Still, growth has been hampered by high prices for Russian natural gas, a Russian import ban on Moldovan wine, increased foreign scrutiny of Moldovan agricultural products, and by Moldova’s large external debt. Over the longer term, Moldova's economy remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, corruption, higher fuel prices, Russian pressure, and the illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.;$13.25 billion (2013 est.)<br />$12.16 billion (2012 est.)<br />$12.26 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US

The economy relies heavily on foreign tourism and the export of refined metals. Unprofitable state-owned enterprises, especially the Podgorica Aluminum Kombine, the country’s largest exporter, weigh heavily on public finances. During the MILOSEVIC era, Montenegro severed its economy from Serbia, maintained its own central bank, adopted the Deutsche Mark, then shifted to the euro - rather than the Yugoslav dinar - as official currency, collected customs tariffs, and managed its own budget. The 2006 dissolution of the loose political union between Serbia and Montenegro led to separate memberships in several international financial institutions, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In January 2007, Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro became the 156th member of World Trade Organization in December 2011. The European Council (EC) granted candidate country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session. Montenegro began negotiations to join the EC in June, 2012, having met the conditions set down by the European Council, which called on Montenegro to take steps to fight corruption and organized crime. Unemployment and disparities in regional development, especially in the north, remain key political and economic problems. The global financial crisis had a significant negative impact on the economy, due to a credit crunch, a decline in the real estate sector, and a fall in aluminum exports. The Government of Montenegro increased value added tax (VAT) from 17% in 2012 to 19% in 2013 and raised income tax rates from 9% to 15% for those earning over €480 a month. In 2013, the government also retrenched by freezing pensions and limiting salary increases for public enterprises and members of the parliament.;$7.429 billion (2013 est.)<br />$7.318 billion (2012 est.)<br />$7.358 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$4.518 billion (2013 est.);1.5% (2013 est.)<br />-0.5% (2012 est.)<br />3.2% (2011 est.);$11,900 (2013 est.)<br />$11,800 (2012 est.)<br />$11,900 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>84.4%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>22.1%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>18.4%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>1.1%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>40.2%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-66.2%<br />(2011 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>0.8%<br /><i>industry: </i>11.3%<br /><i>services: </i>87.9% (2011);tobacco, potatoes, citrus fruits, olives, grapes;steelmaking, aluminum, agricultural processing, consumer goods, tourism;;251,300 (2011 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>6.3%<br /><i>industry: </i>20.9%<br /><i>services: </i>72.8% (2011 est.);19.1% (2012 est.)<br />11.5% (2011 est.);;6.6% (2010 est.);24.3 (2010)<br />30 (2003);<i>revenues: </i>$1.68 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.58 billion (2012 est.);37.2% of GDP (2012 est.);2.2% of GDP (2012 est.);52.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />45% of GDP (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data cover general government debt, and includes debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury;calendar year;4% (2012)<br />3% (2011);;9.69% (31 December 2011 est.)<br />9.53% (31 December 2010 est.);$749 million (31 December 2011 est.)<br />$783.3 million (31 December 2010 est.);$1.982 billion (31 December 2011 est.)<br />$2.01 billion (31 December 2010 est.);$3.29 billion (31 December 2009)<br />$3.771 billion (31 December 2008);$3.827 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$3.322 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$3.604 billion (31 December 2010 est.);-$1.938 billion (2012 est.)<br />-$1.927 billion (2011 est.);$489.2 million (2012 est.)<br />$640 million (2011 est.);;Croatia 22.7%, Serbia 22.7%, Slovenia 7.8% (2012 est.);$2.4 billion (2012 est.)<br />$2.5 billion (2011 est.);;Serbia 29.3%, Greece 8.7%, China 7.1% (2012 est.);$400 million (31 December 2011);$1.7 billion (2012 est.)<br />$1.2 billion (2011 est.);;;euros (EUR) per US dollar -<br />0.7634 (2013 est.)<br />0.7752 (2012 est.)<br />0.755 (2010 est.)<br />0.7198 (2009 est.)<br />0.6827 (2008 est.);;3.945 billion kWh (2010 est.);3.279 billion kWh (2010 est.);730 million kWh (2010 est.);732 million kWh (2010 est.);868,000 kW (2010 est.);24.2% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);75.8% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);4,446 bbl/day (2011 est.);369 bbl/day (2010 est.);3,300 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);2.166 million Mt (2011 est.);163,000 (2012);1.126 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>modern telecommunications system with access to European satellites<br /><i>domestic: </i>GSM mobile-cellular service, available through multiple providers with national coverage, is growing<br /><i>international: </i>country code - 382;state-funded national radio-TV broadcaster operates 2 terrestrial TV networks, 1 satellite TV channel, and 2 radio networks;.me;10,088 (2012);280,000 (2009);;5 (2013);<i>total: </i>5<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>2<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);;1 (2012);;<i>total: </i>250 km<br /><i>standard gauge: </i>250 km 1.435-m gauge (169 km electrified) (2010);<i>total: </i>7,763 km<br /><i>paved: </i>5,365 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>2,398 km (2010);;<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>by type: </i>cargo 1, passenger/cargo 1<br /><i>registered in other countries: </i>4 (Bahamas 2, Honduras 1, Slovakia 1) (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Bar;;Armed Forces of the Republic of Montenegro: Army of Montenegro (includes Montenegrin Navy (Mornarica Crne Gore, MCG)), Air Force (2011);18 is the legal minimum age for voluntary military service;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>149,159<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>131,823 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>3,120<br /><i>female: </i>3,677 (2010 est.);1.87% of GDP (2012)<br />1.95% of GDP (2011)<br />1.87% of GDP (2010);;none;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>6,967 (Kosovo) (2013)<br /><i>stateless persons: </i>3,383 (2012);;

surplus, and important role as a European transportation hub. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The Dutch financial sector suffered as a result of the global financial crisis, due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to US mortgage-backed securities. In 2008, the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars of capital into other financial institutions, to prevent further deterioration of a crucial sector. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the Dutch economy - highly dependent on an international financial sector and international trade - contracted by 3.5% in 2009. To recover, the government sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a government budget deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2010 that contrasted sharply with a surplus of 0.7% in 2008. The government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE began implementing austerity measures in early 2011, mainly reducting expenditures, which resulted in an improved budget deficit in 2011. However, in 2012 tax revenues dropped, GDP contracted, and the budget deficit deteriorated. In 2013, the government budget deficit decreased to 3.3% of GDP due to increased government revenue from higher taxes. However, spending on social benefits also increased, due to a rise in unemployment benefits and payments for pensions. The high unemployment rate and tax increases have contributed to continued decreases in household disposable income, causing the Dutch economy to contract.;$699.7 billion (2013 est.)<br />$705.3

194;Norway;Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994. Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes.

195;Poland;Poland's history as a state begins near the middle of the 10th century. By the mid-16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in central and eastern Europe. During the 18th century, internal disorders weakened the nation, and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive.

Although EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy since 2004, GDP per capita remains significantly below the EU average while unemployment continues to exceed the EU average. The government of Prime Minister Donald TUSK steered the Polish economy through the economic downturn by skillfully managing public finances and adopting controversial pension and tax reforms to further shore up public finances. While the Polish economy has performed well over the past five years, growth slowed in 2012 and 2013, in part due to the ongoing economic difficulties in the euro zone. Short-term, the key policy challenge will be to consolidate debt and spending without stifling economic growth. Over the longer term, Poland's economic performance could improve if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure, business environment, rigid labor code, commercial court system, government red tape, and burdensome tax system.;$814 billion (2013 est.)<br />$803.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$788.6 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data

Over the following two decades, successive governments privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country qualified for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU members. The economy grew by more than the EU average for much of the 1990s, but the rate of growth slowed in 2001-08. The economy contracted in 2009, and fell again from 2011 to 2013, as the government implemented spending cuts and tax increases to comply with conditions of an EU-IMF financial rescue package, signed in May 2011. Austerity measures also have contributed to record unemployment and a wave of emigration not seen since the 1960s. Booming exports will contribute to growth and employment in 2014, but the need to continue to reduce private- and public-sector debt could weigh on consumption and investment. The government of Pedro PASSOS COELHO has stated its intention to reduce labor market rigidity, and, this, along with steps to trim the budget deficit, could make Portugal more attractive to foreign investors. The government reduced the budget deficit from 10.1% of GDP in 2009 to 5.1% in 2013, lower than the EU-IMF fiscal target of 5.5%. Despite these efforts, public debt has continued to grow and, in 2013, stands among the highest in the EU.

began the transition from Communism in 1989 with a largely obsolete industrial base and a pattern of output unsuited to the country's needs. The country emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year recession due to strong demand in EU export markets. Domestic consumption and investment fueled strong GDP growth, but led to large current account imbalances. Romania's macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a middle class and to address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption and red tape continue to permeate the business environment. As a result of the global financial crisis, Romania signed on to a $26 billion emergency assistance package from the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders. GDP contracted from 2009 to 2011. In March 2011, Romania and the IMF/EU/World Bank signed a 24-month precautionary stand-by agreement, worth $6.6 billion, to promote fiscal discipline, encourage progress on structural reforms, and strengthen financial sector stability. In September 2013, the Romanian authorities and the IMF/EU agreed to a follow-on stand-by agreement, worth $5.4 billion, to continue with reforms, although Bucharest announced that it does not intend to draw funds under the agreement.

The economy relies on manufacturing and exports, driven largely by foreign investment. MILOSEVIC-era mismanagement of the economy, an extended period of international economic sanctions, civil war, and the damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure and industry during the NATO airstrikes in 1999 left the economy only half the size it was in 1990. After the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in September 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government implemented stabilization measures and embarked on a market reform program. After renewing its membership in the IMF in December 2000, Serbia continued to reintegrate into the international community by rejoining the World Bank (IBRD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Serbia has made progress in trade liberalization and enterprise restructuring and privatization, but many large enterprises - including the power utilities, telecommunications company, natural gas company, and others - remain in state hands. Serbia has made some progress towards EU membership, signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Brussels in May 2008, and with full implementation of the Interim Trade Agreement with the EU in February 2010, gained candidate status in March 2012. In January 2014, Serbia's EU accession talks officially opened. Serbia's negotiations with the World Trade Organization are advanced, with the country's complete ban on the trade and cultivation of agricultural biotechnology products representing the primary remaining obstacle to accession. Serbia's program with the IMF was frozen in early 2012 because the 2012 budget approved by parliament deviated from the program parameters;$80.47 billion (2013 est.)<br />$78.89 billion (2012 est.)<br

200;Slovakia;Slovakia's roots can be traced to the 9th century state of Great Moravia. Subsequently, the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where they remained for the next 1,000 years. Following the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian (Magyarization) resulted in a strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs, who were under Austrian rule. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World War I, the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar period, Slovak nationalist leaders pushed for autonomy within Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 Slovakia became an independent state allied with Nazi Germany. Following World War II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and came under communist rule within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create &quot;;Central Europe, south of Poland;48 40 N, 19 30 E;<a

After a period of relative stagnation in the early and mid 1990s, reforms to the taxation, healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia consolidate its budget, get on track to join the EU in 2004, and adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands, and the government has facilitated a foreign investment boom with business friendly policies. Foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in the automotive and electronic sectors, fueled much of the growth until 2008. Cheap, skilled labor, low taxes, no dividend taxes, a relatively liberal labor code, and a favorable geographical location are Slovakia's main advantages to foreign investors. Growth returned, following a contraction in 2009, but has remained sluggish in large part due to continued weakness in external demand. In 2012 the government of Prime Minister Robert FICO rolled back some of Slovakia's pro-growth reforms to help shore up public finances. Corruption and slow dispute resolution remain key factors constraining economic growth.;$133.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$132.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$129.6 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b>

201;Slovenia;The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state.

202;Spain;Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic and political power. Spain remained neutral in World War I and II but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. More recently the government has had to focus on measures to reverse a severe economic recession that began in mid-2008. Austerity measures implemented to reduce a large budget deficit and reassure foreign investors have led to one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe.;;Southwestern Europe, bordering the

GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and continued contracting through most of 2013. Economic growth resumed in late 2013, albeit only modestly, as credit contraction in the private sector, fiscal austerity, and high unemployment continued to weigh on domestic consumption and investment. Exports, however, have been resilient throughout the economic downturn, partially offsetting declines in domestic consumption and helped to bring Spain's current account into surplus in 2013 for the first time since 1986. The unemployment rate rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to more than 26% in 2013, straining Spain's public finances as spending on social benefits increased while tax revenues fell. Spain’s budget deficit peaked at 11.4% of GDP in 2009. Spain gradually reduced the deficit to just under 7% of GDP in 2013, slightly above the 6.5% target negotiated between Spain and the EU. Public debt has increased substantially – from 60.1% of GDP in 2010 to 93.4% in 2013. Rising labor productivity, moderating labor costs, and lower inflation have helped to improve foreign investor interest in the economy and to reduce government borrowing costs. The government's ongoing efforts to implement reforms - labor, pension, health, tax, and education - are aimed at supporting investor sentiment. The government also has shored up struggling banks exposed to Spain's depressed domestic construction and real estate sectors by successfully completing an EU-funded restructuring and recapitalization

Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies still engaging in this are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some hunting of seal, reindeer, and fox. Goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and vehicles, normally highly taxed on mainland Norway, are considerably cheaper in Svalbard in an effort by the Norwegian government to entice more people to live on the Arctic archipelago.

It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a highly skilled labor force. In September 2003, Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for vast majority of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for about 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports. This, and robust finances, offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy. Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and the contraction continued in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove a rebound in 2010, but growth slipped in 2013, as a result of continued economic weakness in the EU - Sweden’s main export market.;$393.8 billion (2013 est.)<br />$390.4 billion (2012 est.)<br />$386.7 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$552 billion (2013

205;Switzerland;The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874, replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.;;Central Europe, east of France, north of Italy;47 00 N, 8 00 E;<a

low unemployment, a highly skilled labor force, and a per capita GDP among the highest in the world. Switzerland's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology, knowledge-based production. Its economic and political stability, transparent legal system, exceptional infrastructure, efficient capital markets, and low corporate tax rates also make Switzerland one of the world's most competitive economies. The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural sector. The fate of the Swiss economy is tightly linked to that of its neighbors in the euro zone, which purchases half of all Swiss exports. The global financial crisis of 2008 and resulting economic downturn in 2009 stalled export demand and put Switzerland in a recession. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy to boost the economy as well as prevent appreciation of the franc, and Switzerland's economy began to recover in 2010. The sovereign debt crises currently unfolding in neighboring euro-zone countries pose a significant risk to Switzerland's financial stability and are driving up demand for the Swiss franc by investors seeking a safe-haven currency. The independent SNB has upheld its zero-interest rate policy and conducted major market interventions to prevent further appreciation of the Swiss franc, but parliamentarians have urged it to do more to weaken the currency. The franc's strength has made Swiss exports less competitive and weakened the country's growth outlook;$371.2 billion (2013 est.)<br />$363.9 billion (2012 est.)<br />$360.1 billion (2011 est.)<br

206;Ukraine;Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to achieve a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil liberties.

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991, the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and natural gas requirements and 100% of its nuclear fuel needs. After a two-week dispute that saw gas supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine agreed to 10-year gas supply and transit contracts with Russia in January 2009 that brought gas prices to &quot;$337.4 billion

207;United Kingdom;The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.;;Western Europe, islands - including the northern one-sixth of the

Over the past two decades, the government has greatly reduced public ownership. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with less than 2% of the labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil resources, but its oil and natural gas reserves are declining and the UK became a net importer of energy in 2005. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business services, are key drivers of British GDP growth. Manufacturing, meanwhile, has declined in importance but still accounts for about 10% of economic output. After emerging from recession in 1992, Britain's economy enjoyed the longest period of expansion on record during which time growth outpaced most of Western Europe. In 2008, however, the global financial crisis hit the economy particularly hard, due to the importance of its financial sector. Falling home prices, high consumer debt, and the global economic slowdown compounded Britain's economic problems, pushing the economy into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompting the then BROWN (Labour) government to implement a number of measures to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets;$2.387 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$2.343 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$2.341 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$2.49 trillion (2013 est.);1.8% (2013 est.)<br />0.1% (2012 est.)<br />0.9% (2011 est.);$37,300 (2013 est.)<br />$37,100 (2012 est.)<br />$37,300 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;10.5% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />11% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />13.7% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>66.5%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>21.4%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>13.8%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.4%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>31.1%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-33.2%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>0.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>20.5%<br /><i>services: </i>78.9% (2013 est.);cereals, oilseed, potatoes, vegetables;machine tools, electric power equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment, shipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, electronics and communications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper and paper products, food processing, textiles, clothing, other consumer goods;-0.3% (2013 est.);30.15 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.4%<br /><i>industry: </i>18.2%<br /><i>services: </i>80.4% (2006 est.);7.2% (2013 est.)<br />7.8% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>1.7%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>31.1% (2012);16.2% (2011 est.);32.3 (2012)<br />34 (2005);<i>revenues: </i>$1.023 trillion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.112 trillion (2013 est.);41.1% of GDP (2013 est.);-3.6% of GDP (2013 est.);91.1% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />88.7% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data cover general government debt, and include debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury;6 April -

208;Armenia;Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828;;Southwestern Asia, between Turkey (to the west) and Azerbaijan;40 00 N, 45 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/middle_east.pdf">Middle East</a>;<i>total: </i>29,743 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>28,203 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>1,540 sq km;slightly smaller than Maryland;<i>total: </i>1,570 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Azerbaijan 996 km, Georgia 219 km, Iran 44 km, Turkey 311 km;0 km (landlocked);none (landlocked);highland continental, hot summers, cold winters;Armenian Highland with mountains;<i>lowest point: </i>Debed River 400 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Aragats Lerrnagagat' 4,090 m;small deposits of gold, copper, molybdenum, zinc, bauxite;<i>arable land: </i>14.47%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>1.8%<br /><i>other: </i>83.74% (2011);2,735 sq km (2006);7.77 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>2.86 cu km/yr (40%/6%/54%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>929.7 cu m/yr (2010);occasionally severe earthquakes;soil pollution from toxic chemicals such as DDT;<i>party to: </i>Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants;landlocked in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains;<i>noun: </i>Armenian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Armenian;Armenian 98.1%, Yezidi (Kurd) 1.1%, other 0.7% (2011 est.);Armenian (official) 97.9%, Kurdish (spoken by Yezidi minority) 1%, other 1% (2011 est.);Armenian Apostolic 92.6%, Evangelical 1%, other 2.4%, none 1.1%, unspecified 2.9% (2011 est.);;3,060,631 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>19.1% (male 312,955/female 272,065)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>15.2% (male 236,317/female 228,943)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>43.5% (male 638,141/female 693,397)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>11.7% (male 161,102/female 195,714)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>10.5% (male 128,568/female 193,429) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>44.1 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>29.1 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>14.9 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>6.7 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>33.7 years<br /><i>male: </i>31.8 years<br /><i>female: </i>35.8 years (2014 est.);-0.13% (2014 est.);13.92 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);9.3 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-5.88 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>64.1% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>0.34% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);YEREVAN (capital) 1.116 million (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.14 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.15 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.03 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>0.92 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.93 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.59 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.89 male(s)/female (2014 est.);30 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>13.97 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>15.39 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>12.36 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>74.12 years<br /><i>male: </i>70.9 years<br /><i>female: </i>77.78 years (2014 est.);54.9% (2010);1.64 children born/woman (2014 est.);4.3% of GDP (2011);2.85 physicians/1,000 population (2011);4 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 99.7% of population<br />rural: 100% of population<br />total: 99.8% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 0.3% of population<br />rural: 0% of population<br />total: 0.2% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 95.9% of population<br />rural: 80.9% of population<br />total: 90.5% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 4.1% of population<br />rural: 19.1% of population<br />total: 9.5% of population (2012 est.);0.2% (2012 est.);3,500 (2012 est.);200 (2012 est.);;24% (2008);5.3% (2010);3.3% of GDP (2012);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>99.6%<br /><i>male: </i>99.7%<br /><i>female: </i>99.5% (2011 est.);<i>total: </i>12 years<br /><i>male: </i>11 years<br /><i>female: </i>14 years (2009);23.5 (2011 est.);<i>total: </i>39.2%<br /><i>male: </i>35%<br /><i>female: </i>45% (2011);;<i>total number: </i>19,596<br /><i>percentage: </i>4 %<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data represents children ages 7-17 (2007 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of Armenia<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Armenia<br /><i>local long form: </i>Hayastani Hanrapetut'yun<br /><i>local short form: </i>Hayastan<br /><i>former: </i>Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Armenian Republic;;;republic;;<i>name: </i>Yerevan<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>40 10 N, 44 30 E<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC+4 (9 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time);11 provinces (marzer, singular -

Sharp declines in the construction sector and workers' remittances, particularly from Russia, led the downturn. The economy began to recover in 2010 with 2.1% growth, and has grown even faster in the three years since then. Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia's geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made it particularly vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the economic downturn in Russia. Since August 2011, Armenia has experienced a sharp currency depreciation. Armenia has only two open trade borders - Iran and Georgia - because its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as a result of Armenia's ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the energy sector. The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's RAO-UES in 2005. Natural gas is primarily imported from Russia but construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas deliveries expanded after the April 2010 completion of the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective and the economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax revenue and forced the government to accept large loan packages from Russia, the IMF, and other international financial institutions.

Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Baku-Novorossiysk, and the Baku-Supsa pipelines remain the main economic driver, but efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. The eventual completion of the geopolitically important Southern Gas Corridor between Azerbaijan and Europe will open up another, albeit, smaller source of revenue from gas exports. Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress, including the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects depend on world oil prices, Azerbaijan's ability to negotiate export routes for its growing gas production, and its ability to use its energy wealth to promote growth and spur employment in non-energy sectors of the economy.;$102.7 billion (2013 est.)<br />$97.04 billion (2012 est.)<br />$94.98 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$76.01

210;Bahrain;In 1783, the Sunni Al-Khalifa family took power in Bahrain. In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. Facing declining oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has become an international banking center. Bahrain's small size and central location among Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. The Sunni-led government has struggled to manage relations with its large Shia-majority population. In early 2011, amid Arab uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government confronted similar protests at home with police and military action, including deploying Gulf Cooperation Council security forces to Bahrain. Sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces continue in Bahrain. Ongoing dissatisfaction with the political status quo has led to a broader discussion termed the Bahrain National Dialogue, a process that convenes members of the executive, parliament, and political societies in an attempt to reach a political agreement.;;Middle East, archipelago in the Persian Gulf, east of Saudi Arabia;26 00 N, 50 33 E;<a

Israeli-imposed border closures, which became more restrictive after HAMAS seized control of the territory in June 2007, have resulted in high unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and a sharp contraction of the private sector that had relied primarily on export markets. Gazans increasingly turned to tunnels that ran under the Egyptian border to bring in fuel, construction materials, and consumer goods. In July 2013, Egyptian authorities began a serious crackdown on the tunnels, causing shortages in Gaza. The population depends on government spending - by both the Palestinian Authority and HAMAS's de facto government - and humanitarian assistance. Changes to Israeli restrictions on imports in 2010 resulted in a rebound in some economic activity, but regular exports from Gaza still are not permitted.

212;Georgia;The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D., and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1921 and regained its independence when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Mounting public discontent over rampant corruption and ineffective government services, followed by an attempt by the incumbent Georgian Government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995.

213;Iran;Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces led by Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a popularly elected 86-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations became strained when a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held embassy personnel hostages until mid-January 1981. The US cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980. During the period 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces. Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued involvement in terrorism and concerns over possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as conservative politicians, supported by the Supreme Leader, unelected institutions of authority like the Council of Guardians, and the security services reversed and blocked reform measures while increasing security repression. Starting with nationwide municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005 inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests over allegations of electoral fraud. These protests were quickly suppressed, and the political opposition that arouse as a consequence of AHMADI-NEJAD's election was repressed. Deteriorating economic conditions due primarily to government mismanagement and international sanctions prompted at least two major economically based protests in July and October 2012, but Iran's internal security situation remained stable. President AHMADI-NEJAD's independent streak angered regime establishment figures, including the Supreme Leader, leading to conservative opposition to his agenda for the last year of his presidency, and an alienation of his political supporters. In June 2013 Iranians elected a moderate conservative cleric, Dr. Hasan Fereidun RUHANI to the presidency. He is a long-time senior member in the regime, but has made promises of reforming society and Iran's foreign policy. The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and responsibilities, but in November 2013 the five permanent members, plus Germany, (P5+1) signed a joint plan with Iran to provide the country with incremental relief from international pressure for positive steps toward transparency of their nuclear program.;;Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea, between Iraq and Pakistan;32 00 N, 53 00 E;<a

Price controls, subsidies, and other distortions weigh down the economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth. Private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale workshops, farming, some manufacturing, and services. Significant informal market activity flourishes and corruption is widespread. New fiscal and monetary constraints on Tehran, following the expansion of international sanctions in 2012 against Iran's Central Bank and oil exports, significantly reduced Iran's oil revenue, forced government spending cuts, and fueled a 60% currency depreciation. Economic growth turned negative in 2012 and 2013, for the first time in two decades. Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and underemployment.

and foreign investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic development, long-term fiscal health, and sustained improvements in the overall standard of living still depend on the central government passing major policy reforms. Iraq's largely state-run economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides more than 90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings. Iraq in 2012 boosted oil exports to a 30-year high of 2.6 million barrels per day, a significant increase from Iraq's average of 2.2 million in 2011. Government revenues increased as global oil prices remained persistently high for much of 2012. Iraq's contracts with major oil companies have the potential to further expand oil exports and revenues, but Iraq will need to make significant upgrades to its oil processing, pipeline, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach their economic potential. The Iraqi Kurdistan Region's (IKR) autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) passed its own oil law in 2007, and has directly signed about 50 contracts to develop IKR energy reserves. The federal government has disputed the legal authority of the KRG to conclude most of these contracts, some of which are also in areas with unresolved administrative boundaries in dispute between the federal and regional government. Iraq is making slow progress enacting laws and developing the institutions needed to implement economic policy, and political reforms are still needed to assuage investors' concerns regarding the uncertain business climate, which may have been harmed by the November 2012 standoff between Baghdad and Erbil and the removal of the Central Bank Governor in October 2012. The government of Iraq is eager to attract additional foreign direct investment, but it faces a number of obstacles including a tenuous political system and concerns about security and societal stability. Rampant corruption, outdated infrastructure, insufficient essential services, skilled labor shortages, and antiquated commercial laws stifle investment and continue to constrain growth of private, nonoil sectors. Iraq is considering a package of laws to establish a modern legal framework for the oil sector and a mechanism to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation, although these reforms are still under contentious and sporadic negotiation. Under the Iraqi Constitution, some competencies relevant to the overall investment climate are either shared by the federal government and the regions or are devolved entirely to the regions. Investment in the IKR operates within the framework of the Kurdistan Region Investment Law (Law 4 of 2006) and the Kurdistan Board of Investment, which is designed to provide incentives to help economic development in areas under the authority of the KRG. Inflation has remained under control since 2006 as security improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed to translate macroeconomic gains into an improved standard of living for the Iraqi populace. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country despite a bloated public sector. Encouraging private enterprise through deregulation would make it easier for Iraqi citizens and foreign investors to start new businesses. Rooting out corruption and implementing reforms - such as restructuring banks and developing the private sector - would be important steps in this direction.;$249.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$239.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$220.7 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$221.8 billion (2013 est.);4.2% (2013 est.)<br />8.4% (2012 est.)<br />8.6% (2011 est.);$7,100 (2013 est.)<br />$7,100 (2012 est.)<br />$6,800 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;;<i>agriculture: </i>3.3%<br /><i>industry: </i>64.6%<br /><i>services: </i>32.1% (2013 est.);wheat, barley, rice, vegetables, dates, cotton;petroleum, chemicals, textiles, leather, construction materials, food processing, fertilizer, metal fabrication/processing;6.9% (2013 est.);8.9 million (2010 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>21.6%<br /><i>industry: </i>18.7%<br /><i>services: </i>59.8% (2008 est.);16% (2012 est.)<br />15% (2010 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.6%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>25.7% (2007 est.);25% (2008 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$99.52 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$97.42 billion (2013 est.);44.9% of GDP (2013 est.);0.9% of GDP (2013 est.);;calendar year;2% (2013 est.)<br />6.1% (2012 est.);6% (December 2012)<br />6% (December 2011);6% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />6% (31 December 2012 est.);$62.33 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$54.68 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$74.81 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$64.74 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$-3.902 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$-3.981 million (31 December 2012 est.);$4 billion (9 December 2011)<br />$2.6 billion (31 July 2010)<br />$2 billion (31 July 2009 est.);$12.85 billion (2013 est.)<br />$29.54 billion (2012 est.);$91.99 billion (2013 est.)<br />$94.21 billion (2012 est.);crude oil 84%, crude materials excluding fuels, food and live animals;US 21.1%, India 20.2%, China 13.6%, South Korea 11%, Canada 4.7%, Italy 4.4%, Spain 4.2% (2012);$66.61 billion (2013 est.)<br />$50.16 billion (2012 est.);food, medicine, manufactures;Turkey 27.5%, Syria 16.2%, China 12.5%, US 5.2%, South Korea 4.7% (2012);$71.24 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$70.33 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$59.49 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$60.2 billion (31 December 2012 est.);;;Iraqi dinars (IQD) per US dollar -<br />1,166 (2013 est.)<br />1,166.17 (2012 est.)<br />1,170 (2010 est.)<br />1,170 (2009)<br />1,176 (2008);;62.3 billion kWh (2013 est.);53.41 billion kWh (2013 est.);0 kWh (2013 est.);9.802 billion kWh (2013 est.);11.2 million kW (2013 est.);92% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);7.6% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2013 est.);2.979 million bbl/day (2013 est.);2.39 million bbl/day (2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2013 est.);141.4 billion bbl (1 January 2013 est.);492,800 bbl/day (2010 est.);818,000 bbl/day (2011 est.);3,832 bbl/day (2010 est.);172,600 bbl/day (2010 est.);880 million cu m (2011 est.);1.3 billion cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);3.158 trillion cu m (1 January 2013 est.);139.4 million Mt (2011 est.);1.87 million (2012);26.76 million (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>the 2003 liberation of Iraq severely disrupted telecommunications throughout Iraq including international connections;the number of private radio and TV stations has increased rapidly since 2003;.iq;26 (2012);325,900 (2009);;102 (2013);<i>total: </i>72<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>20<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>34<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>4<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>7<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>7 (2013);<i>total: </i>30<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>3<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>5<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>3<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>13<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>6 (2013);16 (2013);gas 2,455 km;<i>total: </i>2,370 km<br /><i>standard gauge: </i>2,370 km 1.435-m gauge (2012);<i>total: </i>59,623 km<br /><i>paved: </i>59,623 km (includes Kurdistan Region) (2012);5,279 km (the Euphrates River (2,815 km), Tigris River (1,899 km), and Third River (565 km) are the principal waterways) (2012);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>by type: </i>petroleum tanker 2<br /><i>registered in other countries: </i>2 (Marshall Islands 2) (2010);<i>river port(s): </i>Al Basrah (Shatt al-'Arab);;Counterterrorism Service Forces: Counterterrorism Command;18-40 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>7,767,329<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>7,461,766 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>6,591,185<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>6,421,717 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>332,194<br /><i>female: </i>322,010 (2010 est.);2.88% of GDP (2012)<br />3.27% of GDP (2011)<br />2.88% of GDP (2010);;Iraq's lack of a maritime boundary with Iran prompts jurisdiction disputes beyond the mouth of the Shatt al Arab in the Persian Gulf;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>15,496 (Turkey);;
215;Israel;Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine, and the UN proposed partitioning the area into Arab and Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Nonetheless, an Israeli state was declared in 1948 and the Israelis subsequently defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. (The territories Israel occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile, unless otherwise noted.) On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement.

Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and pharmaceuticals are among the leading exports. Its major imports include crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by tourism and other service exports, as well as significant foreign investment inflows. Between 2004 and 2011, growth averaged nearly 5% per year, led by exports. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals, following years of prudent fiscal policy and a resilient banking sector. In 2010, Israel formally acceded to the OECD. Israel's economy also has weathered the Arab Spring because strong trade ties outside the Middle East have insulated the economy from spillover effects. The economy has recovered better than most advanced, comparably sized economies, but slowing demand domestically and internationally, and a strong shekel, have reduced forecasts for the next decade to the 3% level. Natural gas fields discovered off Israel's coast since 2009 have brightened Israel's energy security outlook. The Tamar and Leviathan fields were some of the world's largest offshore natural gas finds this past decade. The massive Leviathan field is not due to come online until 2018, but production from Tamar provided a one percentage point boost to Israel's GDP in 2013 and is expected to contribute 0.5% growth in 2014. In mid-2011, public protests arose around income inequality and rising housing and commodity prices. Israel's income inequality and poverty rates are among the highest of OECD countries and there is a broad perception among the public that a small number of &quot;$273.2 billion (2013 est.)<br

216;Jordan;Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the League of Nations awarded Britain the mandate to govern much of the Middle East. Britain demarcated a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine in the early 1920s. The area gained its independence in 1946 and thereafter became The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The country's long-time ruler, King HUSSEIN (1953-99), successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian population.

Other economic challenges for the government include chronic high rates of poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large budget deficit. Since assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening the trade regime, privatizing state-owned companies, and eliminating some fuel subsidies, which in the last decade spurred economic growth by attracting foreign investment and creating some jobs. The global economic slowdown and regional turmoil, however, have depressed Jordan's GDP growth, impacting export-oriented sectors, construction, and tourism. In 2011 and 2012, the government approved two economic relief packages and a budgetary supplement, meant to improve the living conditions for the middle and poor classes. Jordan's finances have also been strained by a series of natural gas pipeline attacks in Egypt, causing Jordan to substitute more expensive diesel imports, primarily from Saudi Arabia, to generate electricity. Jordan is currently exploring nuclear power generation in addition to the exploitation of abundant oil shale reserves and renewable technologies to forestall energy shortfalls. In 2012, to correct budgetary and balance of payments imbalances, Jordan entered into a $2.1 billion, multiple year International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively isolated from the international financial crisis because of its limited exposure to overseas capital markets. In 2013, Jordan depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance the budget deficit, as the influx of about 600,000 Syrian refugees put additional pressure on expenditures.;$40.02 billion (2013

217;Kuwait;Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling Kuwaiti AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961. Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a ground assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four days. Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure damaged during 1990-91. The AL-SABAH family has ruled since returning to power in 1991 and reestablished an elected legislature that in recent years has become increasingly assertive. The country witnessed the historic election in 2009 of four women to its National Assembly. Amid the 2010-11 uprisings and protests across the Arab world, stateless Arabs, known as bidun, staged small protests in February and March 2011 demanding citizenship, jobs, and other benefits available to Kuwaiti nationals. Youth activist groups - supported by opposition legislators - rallied repeatedly in 2011 for the prime minister's dismissal amid allegations of widespread government corruption. Demonstrators forced the prime minister to resign in late 2011. In late 2012, Kuwait witnessed unprecedented protests in response to the Amir's changes to the electoral law by decree reducing the number of votes per person from four to one. The opposition, led by a coalition of Sunni Islamists, tribalists, some liberals, and myriad youth groups, largely boycotted legislative elections in 2012 and 2013 ushering in legislatures more amenable to the government's agenda. Since 2006, the Amir has dissolved the National Assembly on five occasions (the Constitutional Court annulled the Assembly in June 2012 and again in June 2013) and shuffled the cabinet over a dozen times, usually citing political stagnation and gridlock between the legislature and the government.;;Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iraq and Saudi Arabia;29 30 N, 45 45 E;<a

Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 95% of export revenues, and 95% of government income. Kuwaiti officials have committed to increasing oil production to 4 million barrels per day by 2020. Budget surpluses have stayed around 30% of GDP, which has led to higher budget expenditures, particularly wage hikes for many public sector employees, as well as increased allotments to Kuwait’s Future Generations Fund. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in part, because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due to the poor business climate and the historically acrimonious relationship between the National Assembly and the executive branch, which has stymied most movement on economic reforms. In 2010, Kuwait passed an economic development plan that pledges to spend up to $130 billion over five years to diversify the economy away from oil, attract more investment, and boost private sector participation in the economy, though much of these funds have yet to be allocated.;$165.8 billion (2013 est.)<br />$159.6 billion (2012 est.)<br />$144.8 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$179.5 billion (2013 est.);2.3% (2013 est.)<br />8.3% (2012 est.)<br />10.2% (2011 est.);$42,100 (2013 est.)<br />$41,800 (2012 est.)<br />$39,200 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;54.8% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />58.9% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />58.2% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>23.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16.4%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>16.2%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>68.5%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-25.1%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>0.3%<br /><i>industry: </i>50.6%<br /><i>services: </i>49.1% (2013 est.);fish;petroleum, petrochemicals, cement, shipbuilding and repair, water desalination, food processing, construction materials;4.1% (2013 est.);2.38 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>non-Kuwaitis represent about 60% of the labor force (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>NA%<br /><i>industry: </i>NA%<br /><i>services: </i>NA%;3.4% (2011 est.)<br />2.9% (2010);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$114.1 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$61.81 billion (2013 est.);63.6% of GDP (2013 est.);29.2% of GDP (2013 est.);6.4% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />6.3% of GDP (2012 est.);1 April -

218;Lebanon;Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French demarcated the region of Lebanon in 1920 and granted this area independence in 1943. Since independence the country has been marked by periods of political turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on its position as a regional center for finance and trade. The country's 1975-90 civil war that resulted in an estimated 120,000 fatalities, was followed by years of social and political instability. Sectarianism is a key element of Lebanese political life. Neighboring Syria has long influenced Lebanon's foreign policy and internal policies, and its military occupied Lebanon from 1976 until 2005. The Lebanon-based Hizballah militia and Israel continued attacks and counterattacks against each other after Syria's withdrawal, and fought a brief war in 2006. Lebanon's borders with Syria and Israel remain unresolved.;;Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and Syria;33 50 N, 35 50 E;<a

219;Oman;The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, a newly established sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and military advisors increased, but it never became a British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew his father, and he has since ruled as sultan. His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries. Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa beginning in January 2011, some Omanis began staging marches, demonstrations, and sit-ins calling mostly for more jobs and economic benefits and an end to corruption. In response to those protester demands, QABOOS in 2011 pledged to implement economic and political reforms, such as granting legislative and regulatory powers to the Majlis al-Shura and introducing unemployment benefits. Additionally, in August 2012, the Sultan announced a royal directive mandating the speedy implementation of a national job creation plan for thousands of public and private sector jobs. As part of the government's efforts to decentralize authority and allow greater citizen participation in local governance, Oman successfully conducted its first municipal council elections in December 2012. Announced by the Sultan in 2011, the municipal councils will have the power to advise the Royal Court on the needs of local districts across Oman's 11 governorates.;;Middle East, bordering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf, between Yemen and UAE;21 00 N, 57 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/middle_east.pdf">Middle East</a>;<i>total: </i>309,500 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>309,500 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km;slightly smaller than Kansas;<i>total: </i>1,573 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Saudi Arabia 676 km, UAE 609 km, Yemen 288 km;2,092 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm;dry desert;central desert plain, rugged mountains in north and south;<i>lowest point: </i>Arabian Sea 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Jabal Shams 2,980 m;petroleum, copper, asbestos, some marble, limestone, chromium, gypsum, natural gas;<i>arable land: </i>0.1%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.12%<br /><i>other: </i>99.77% (2011);588.5 sq km (2004);1.4 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>1.32 cu km/yr (10%/1%/88%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>515.8 cu m/yr (2003);summer winds often raise large sandstorms and dust storms in interior;rising soil salinity;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;strategic location on Musandam Peninsula adjacent to Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for world crude oil;<i>noun: </i>Omani(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Omani;Arab, Baluchi, South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi), African;Arabic (official), English, Baluchi, Urdu, Indian dialects;Muslim (official;;3,219,775<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>immigrants make up just over 30% of the total population, according to UN data (2013) (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>30.4% (male 501,352/female 476,333)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>19.9% (male 335,404/female 304,261)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>42.6% (male 801,539/female 569,187)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>3.9% (male 67,085/female 58,254)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>3.2% (male 53,320/female 53,040) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>34.4 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>30.4 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>3.9 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>25.4 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>24.9 years<br /><i>male: </i>26.1 years<br /><i>female: </i>23.4 years (2014 est.);2.06% (2014 est.);24.47 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);3.38 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-0.45 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>73.4% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>2.23% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);MUSCAT (capital) 743,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.1 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1.41 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>1.2 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>1.03 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>1.22 male(s)/female (2014 est.);32 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>14 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>14.29 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>13.69 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>74.97 years<br /><i>male: </i>73.07 years<br /><i>female: </i>76.97 years (2014 est.);31.7% (2000);2.86 children born/woman (2014 est.);2.3% of GDP (2011);2.05 physicians/1,000 population (2010);1.8 beds/1,000 population (2009);<i>improved: </i>urban: 95.5% of population<br />rural: 86.1% of population<br />total: 93% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 4.5% of population<br />rural: 13.9% of population<br />total: 7% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 97.3% of population<br />rural: 94.7% of population<br />total: 96.6% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 2.7% of population<br />rural: 5.3% of population<br />total: 3.4% of population (2012 est.);0.1% (2009 est.);1,100 (2009 est.);fewer than 100 (2009 est.);;20.9% (2008);8.6% (2009);4.3% of GDP (2009);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>86.9%<br /><i>male: </i>90.2%<br /><i>female: </i>81.8% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>14 years<br /><i>male: </i>13 years<br /><i>female: </i>14 years (2011);;;;;<i>conventional long form: </i>Sultanate of Oman<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Oman<br /><i>local long form: </i>Saltanat Uman<br /><i>local short form: </i>Uman<br /><i>former: </i>Muscat and Oman;;;monarchy;;<i>name: </i>Muscat<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>23 37 N, 58 35 E<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC+4 (9 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time);11 governorates (muhafazat, singular -

Because of declining reserves and a rapidly growing labor force, Muscat has actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification, industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by 2020 and creating more jobs to employ the rising numbers of Omanis entering the workforce. Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government's diversification strategy. However, increases in social welfare benefits, particularly since the Arab Spring, will challenge the government's ability to effectively balance its budget if oil revenues decline. By using enhanced oil recovery techniques, Oman succeeded in increasing oil production, giving the country more time to diversify, and the increase in global oil prices through 2011 provided the government greater financial resources to invest in non-oil sectors. In 2012, continued surpluses resulting from sustained high oil prices and increased enhanced oil recovery allowed the government to maintain growth in social subsidies and public sector job creation. However, the Sultan made widely reported statements indicating this would not be sustainable, and called for expanded efforts to support SME development and entrepreneurship. Government agencies and large oligarchic group companies heeded his call, announcing new initiatives to spin off non-essential functions to entrepreneurs, incubate new businesses, train and mentor up and coming business people, and provide financing for start-ups. In response to fast growth in household indebtedness, the Central Bank reduced the ceiling on personal interest loans from 8 to 7%, lowered mortgage rates, capped the percentage of consumer loans at 50% of borrower's salaries for personal loans and 60% for housing loans, and limited maximum repayment terms to 10 and 25 years respectively.;$94.86 billion (2013 est.)<br />$90.28 billion (2012

220;Qatar;Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by the Amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son, the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew the father in a bloodless coup in 1995. In short order, HAMAD oversaw the creation of the pan-Arab satellite news network Al-Jazeera and Qatar's pursuit of a leadership role in mediating regional conflicts. In the 2000s, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, oil and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar has not experienced domestic unrest or violence like that seen in other Near Eastern and North African countries in 2010-11, due in part to its immense wealth. Since the outbreak of regional unrest, however, Doha has prided itself on its support for many of these popular revolutions, particularly in Libya and Syria. In mid-2013, HAMAD transferred power to his 33 year-old son, TAMIM bin Hamad - a peaceful abdication rare in the history of Arab Gulf states. TAMIM has prioritized improving the domestic welfare of Qataris, including establishing advanced healthcare and education systems and expanding the country's infrastructure in anticipation of Doha's hosting of the 2022 World Cup.;;Middle East, peninsula bordering the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia;25 30 N, 51 15 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/middle_east.pdf">Middle East</a>;<i>total: </i>11,586 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>11,586 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km;slightly smaller than Connecticut;<i>total: </i>60 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Saudi Arabia 60 km;563 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>as determined by bilateral agreements or the median line;arid;mostly flat and barren desert covered with loose sand and gravel;<i>lowest point: </i>Persian Gulf 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Tuwayyir al Hamir 103 m;petroleum, natural gas, fish;<i>arable land: </i>1.21%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.17%<br /><i>other: </i>98.62% (2011);129.4 sq km (2003);0.06 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>0.44 cu km/yr (39%/2%/59%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>376.9 cu m/yr (2005);haze, dust storms, sandstorms common;limited natural freshwater resources are increasing dependence on large-scale desalination facilities;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;strategic location in central Persian Gulf near major petroleum deposits;<i>noun: </i>Qatari(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Qatari;Arab 40%, Indian 18%, Pakistani 18%, Iranian 10%, other 14%;Arabic (official), English commonly used as a second language;Muslim 77.5%, Christian 8.5%, other (includes mainly Hindu and other Indian religions) 14% (2004 est.);;2,123,160 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>12.5% (male 134,477/female 130,640)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>13.4% (male 208,278/female 75,889)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>69.9% (male 1,228,151/female 256,099)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>3.4% (male 55,386/female 16,156)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.8% (male 11,226/female 6,858) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>17.1 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>16 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>1.1 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>87.4 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>32.6 years<br /><i>male: </i>33.6 years<br /><i>female: </i>28 years (2014 est.);3.58% (2014 est.);9.95 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);1.53 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);27.35 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>98.8% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>3.01% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);DOHA (capital) 567,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.02 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.03 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>2.75 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>4.8 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>3.37 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>1.5 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>3.29 male(s)/female (2014 est.);7 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>6.42 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>6.67 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>6.16 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>78.38 years<br /><i>male: </i>76.4 years<br /><i>female: </i>80.4 years (2014 est.);;1.92 children born/woman (2014 est.);1.9% of GDP (2011);2.76 physicians/1,000 population (2006);1.2 beds/1,000 population (2009);<i>improved: </i>urban: 100% of population<br />rural: 100% of population<br />total: 100% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 0% of population<br />rural: 0% of population<br />0% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 100% of population<br />rural: 100% of population<br />total: 100% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 0% of population<br />rural: 0% of population<br />total: 0% of population (2012 est.);less than 0.1% (2009 est.);fewer than 200 (2009 est.);fewer than 100 (2009 est.);;33.2% (2008);;2.5% of GDP (2008);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>96.3%<br /><i>male: </i>96.5%<br /><i>female: </i>95.4% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>14 years<br /><i>male: </i>14 years<br /><i>female: </i>14 years (2005);;<i>total: </i>1.3%<br /><i>male: </i>0.4%<br /><i>female: </i>8.9% (2011);;;<i>conventional long form: </i>State of Qatar<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Qatar<br /><i>local long form: </i>Dawlat Qatar<br /><i>local short form: </i>Qatar<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>closest approximation of the native pronunciation is cutter;;;emirate;;<i>name: </i>Doha<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>25 17 N, 51 32 E<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC+3 (8 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time);7 municipalities (baladiyat, singular -

Throughout the financial crisis Qatari authorities sought to protect the local banking sector, with direct investments into domestic banks. GDP is driven largely by changes in oil prices and by investment in the energy sector. Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for more than 50% of GDP, roughly 85% of export earnings, and 50% of government revenues. Oil and gas have made Qatar the world's highest per-capita income country and the country with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil reserves in excess of 25 billion barrels should enable continued output at current levels for about 57 years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, about 13% of the world total and third largest in the world. Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid is accelerating large-scale infrastructure projects such as Qatar's metro system, light rail system, the construction of a new port, roads, stadiums and related sporting infrastructure. The new Hamad International Airport is expected to open in mid-2014 with an annual passenger capacity of 24 million on initial opening and 50 million when complete.;$198.7 billion (2013 est.)<br />$185.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$171.4 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$213.1 billion (2013 est.);5.5% (2013 est.)<br />8.1% (2012 est.)<br />13% (2011 est.);$102,100 (2013 est.)<br />$100,900 (2012 est.)<br />$100,400 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;54.1% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />62.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />59.8% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>13.5%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>13.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>29.3%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>2.5%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>71.7%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-30.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>0.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>72.2%<br /><i>services: </i>27.7% (2013 est.);fruits, vegetables;liquefied natural gas, crude oil production and refining, ammonia, fertilizers, petrochemicals, steel reinforcing bars, cement, commercial ship repair;2.9% (2013 est.);1.424 million (2013 est.);;0.3% (2013 est.)<br />0.5% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>1.3%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>35.9% (2007);NA%;;<i>revenues: </i>$77.54 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$57.25 billion (2013 est.);38.8% of GDP (2013 est.);9.1% of GDP (2013 est.);30.6% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />32.8% of GDP (2012 est.);1 April -

221;Saudi Arabia;Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. One of his male descendants rules the country today, as required by the country's 1992 Basic Law. King ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz ascended to the throne in 2005. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension between the royal family and the public until all operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH since 2005 has worked to incrementally modernize the Kingdom - driven by personal ideology and political pragmatism - through a series of social and economic initiatives, including expanding employment and social opportunities for women, attracting foreign investment, increasing the role of the private sector in the economy, and discouraging businesses from hiring foreign workers. The Arab Spring inspired protests - increasing in number since 2011 but usually small in size - over primarily domestic issues among Saudi Arabia's majority Sunni population. Riyadh has taken a cautious but firm approach by arresting some protesters but releasing most of them quickly, and by using its state-sponsored clerics to counter political and Islamist activism. In addition, Saudi Arabia has seen protests among the Shia populace in the Eastern Province, who have protested primarily against the detention of political prisoners, endemic discrimination, and Bahraini and Saudi Government actions in Bahrain. Protests are met by a strong police presence, with some arrests, but not the level of bloodshed seen in protests elsewhere in the region. In response to the unrest, King ABDALLAH in February and March 2011 announced a series of benefits to Saudi citizens including funds to build affordable housing, salary increases for government workers, and unemployment entitlements. To promote increased political participation, the government held elections nationwide in September 2011 for half the members of 285 municipal councils - a body that holds little influence in the Saudi Government. Also in September, the king announced that women will be allowed to run for and vote in future municipal elections - first held in 2005 - and serve as full members of the advisory Consultative Council. The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds about 17% of the world's proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in 2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are ongoing governmental concerns.;;Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea,

It possesses about 16% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80% of budget revenues, 45% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings. Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and petrochemical sectors. Over 6 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in 2005.

222;Syria;Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence in 1946. The new country lacked political stability, however, and experienced a series of military coups during its first decades. Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz al-ASAD, a member of the socialist Ba'th Party and the minority Alawi sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of President al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally Hizballah. In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD's second term as president was approved by popular referendum. Influenced by major uprisings that began elsewhere in the region, antigovernment protests broke out in the southern province of Dar'a in March 2011 with protesters calling for the repeal of the restrictive Emergency Law allowing arrests without charge, the legalization of political parties, and the removal of corrupt local officials. Since then demonstrations and unrest have spread to nearly every city in Syria, but the size and intensity of protests have fluctuated over time. The government responded to unrest with a mix of concessions - including the repeal of the Emergency Law and approving new laws permitting new political parties and liberalizing local and national elections - and force. However, the government's response has failed to meet opposition demands for ASAD to step down, and the government's ongoing security operations to quell unrest and widespread armed opposition activity have led to extended violent clashes between government forces and oppositionists. International pressure on the ASAD regime has intensified since late 2011, as the Arab League, EU, Turkey, and the United States have expanded economic sanctions against the regime. Lakhdar BRAHIMI, current Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States on the Syrian crisis, in October 2012 began meeting with regional heads of state to assist in brokering a cease-fire. In December 2012, the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces was recognized by more than 130 countries as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Unrest persisted in 2013, and the death toll among Syrian Government forces, opposition forces, and civilians has topped 100,000. In January 2014, the Syrian Opposition Coalition and Syrian regime began peace talks at the UN sponsored Geneva II conference.;;Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Lebanon and Turkey;35 00 N, 38 00 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/middle_east.pdf">Middle East</a>;<i>total: </i>185,180 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>183,630 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>1,550 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes 1,295 sq km of Israeli-occupied territory;slightly more than 1.5 times the size of Pennsylvania<br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/pdf/../../areacomparison/SY_area%202014.jpg">Area comparison map</a>;<i>total: </i>2,253 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Iraq 605 km, Israel 76 km, Jordan 375 km, Lebanon 375 km, Turkey 822 km;193 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm;mostly desert;primarily semiarid and desert plateau;<i>lowest point: </i>unnamed location near Lake Tiberias -200 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Mount Hermon 2,814 m;petroleum, phosphates, chrome and manganese ores, asphalt, iron ore, rock salt, marble, gypsum, hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>24.9%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>5.69%<br /><i>other: </i>69.41% (2011);13,410 sq km (2010);16.8 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>16.76 cu km/yr (9%/4%/88%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>867.4 cu m/yr (2005);dust storms, sandstorms<br /><i>volcanism: </i>Syria's two historically active volcanoes, Es Safa and an unnamed volcano near the Turkish border have not erupted in centuries;deforestation;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Environmental Modification;the capital of Damascus -

The economy further contracted in 2013 because of international sanctions, widespread infrastructure damage, reduced domestic consumption and production, and sharply rising inflation. The government has struggled to address the effects of economic decline, which include dwindling foreign exchange reserves, rising budget and trade deficits, and the decreasing value of the Syrian pound. The ongoing conflict and economic decline have created a humanitarian crisis, prompting widespread need for international aid. Prior to the unrest, Damascus began liberalizing economic policies, including cutting lending interest rates, opening private banks, consolidating multiple exchange rates, raising prices on some subsidized items, and establishing the Damascus Stock Exchange. The economy remains highly regulated by the government. Long-run economic constraints include foreign trade barriers, declining oil production, high unemployment, rising budget deficits, increasing pressure on water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and water pollution.;$107.6 billion (2011 est.)<br />$110.1 billion (2010 est.)<br />$106.5 billion (2009 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b>

An aggressive privatization program has reduced state involvement in basic industry, banking, transport, and communication, and an emerging cadre of middle-class entrepreneurs is adding dynamism to the economy and expanding production beyond the traditional textiles and clothing sectors. The automotive, construction, and electronics industries are rising in importance and have surpassed textiles within Turkey's export mix. Oil began to flow through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006, marking a major milestone that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to market. Several gas pipelines projects also are moving forward to help transport Central Asian gas to Europe through Turkey, which over the long term will help address Turkey's dependence on imported oil and gas to meet 97% of its energy needs. After Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara adopted financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The reforms strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in an era of strong growth averaging more than 6% annually until 2008. Global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy caused GDP to contract in 2009, but Turkey's well-regulated financial markets and banking system helped the country weather the global financial crisis and GDP rebounded strongly to around 9% in 2010-11, as exports returned to normal levels following the recession. Growth dropped to roughly 3-4% in 2012-13. Turkey's public sector debt to GDP ratio has fallen below 40%, and two rating agencies upgraded Turkey's debt to investment grade in 2012 and 2013. Turkey remains dependent on often volatile, short-term investment to finance its large current account deficit. The stock value of FDI reached nearly $195 billion at year-end 2013, reflecting Turkey's robust growth even in the face of economic turmoil in Europe, the source of much of Turkey's FDI. Turkey's relatively high current account deficit, domestic political uncertainty, and turmoil within Turkey's neighborhood leave the economy vulnerable to destabilizing shifts in investor confidence.;$1.167 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$1.124 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$1.101 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$821.8 billion (2013 est.);3.8% (2013

224;United Arab Emirates;The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Dhabi, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of leading West European nations. Its high oil revenues and its moderate foreign policy stance have allowed the UAE to play a vital role in the affairs of the region. For more than three decades, oil and global finance drove the UAE's economy. However, in 2008-09, the confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real estate prices, and the international banking crisis hit the UAE especially hard.

225;West Bank;From the early 16th century through 1917, the area now known as the West Bank fell under Ottoman rule. Following World War I, the Allied powers (France, UK, Russia) allocated the area to the British Mandate of Palestine. After World War II, the UN passed a resolution to establish two states within the Mandate, and designated a territory including what is now known as the West Bank as part of the proposed Arab state. Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the area was captured by Transjordan (later renamed Jordan). Jordan annexed the West Bank in 1950. In June 1967, Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War. With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli-Jordanian border zone, the West Bank has remained under Israeli military control. Under a series of agreements signed between 1994 and 1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank as well as the Gaza Strip.

Inflows of donor aid and government spending have driven most of the gains, however. Private sector development has been weak. After a multiyear downturn following the start of the second intifada in 2000, overall standard-of-living measures have recovered and now exceed levels seen in the late 1990s. Despite the Palestinian Authority's (PA) successful implementation of economic and security reforms and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the Israeli Government, Israeli closure policies continue to disrupt labor and trade flows, industrial capacity, and basic commerce, eroding the productive capacity of the West Bank economy. The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West Bank remain Palestinians' inability to access land and resources in Israeli-controlled areas, import and export restrictions, and a high-cost capital structure. The PA for the foreseeable future will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs, and West Bank economic activity will depend largely on the PA's ability to attract such aid.;$8.022 billion (2011 est.)<br />$7.589 billion (2010 est.)<br />$7.106 billion (2009 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2011 US dollars;$6.641 billion<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip (2008 est.);5.7% (2011 est.)<br />6.8% (2010 est.)<br />7% (2009 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip;$2,900 (2008 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip;;<i>household consumption: </i>99.5%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>29.5%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>18%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>14.9%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-62%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>4.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>17.9%<br /><i>services: </i>77.9%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip (2012 est.);olives, citrus fruit, vegetables;small-scale manufacturing, quarrying, textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs;3% (2013 est.);1.025 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>16.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>28.4%<br /><i>services: </i>55.5%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip (2010 est.);22.5% (2013 est.)<br />23% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.2%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>28.2% (2009 est.);18.3% (2010 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$2.1 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$3.2 billion<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Palestinian Authority expenditures in the Gaza Strip (2011 est.);31.6% of GDP (2011 est.);-16.6% of GDP (2011 est.);;calendar year;1.7% (2013 est.)<br />2.8% (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip;;6.8% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />6.97% (31 December 2012 est.);$232.2 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$180.2 million (31 December 2012 est.);$9.301 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$8.143 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.248 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.042 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$2.634 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$2.532 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$2.45 billion (31 December 2010 est.);-$2.1 billion (2011 est.)<br />-$690.7 million (2010 est.);$666.1 million (2010 est.)<br />$846.1 million (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip;stone, olives, fruit, vegetables, limestone;;$5.474 billion (2011 est.)<br />$4.319 billion (2010 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data include the Gaza Strip;food, consumer goods, construction materials, petroleum, chemicals;;;$NA (2010 est.)<br />$1.3 billion (2007 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data include the Gaza Strip;;;new Israeli shekels (ILS) per US dollar -<br />3.621 (2013 est.)<br />3.856 (2012 est.)<br />3.73 (2010)<br />3.932 (2009)<br />3.588 (2008);;445 million kWh (2010 est.);4.573 billion kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012);550 million kWh (2011 est.);140,000 kW<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2009 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);29,310 bbl/day (2011 est.);515 bbl/day (2010 est.);16,330 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);2.502 million Mt (2011 est.);406,000 (includes Gaza Strip) (2012);3.041 million (includes Gaza Strip) (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>continuing political and economic instability has impeded significant liberalization of the telecommunications industry<br /><i>domestic: </i>Israeli company BEZEK and the Palestinian company PALTEL are responsible for fixed line services;the Palestinian Authority operates 1 TV and 1 radio station;.ps;;1.379 million (includes Gaza Strip) (2009);;2 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);;1 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>4,686 km<br /><i>paved: </i>4,686 km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Gaza Strip (2010);;;;;;;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>579,248<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>547,782 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>30,925<br /><i>female: </i>29,440 (2010 est.);;;the current status of the West Bank is subject to the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement - permanent status to be determined through further negotiation;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>754,411 (Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)) (2014)<br /><i>IDPs: </i>at least 146,000 (persons displaced within both the Gaza strip and the West Bank, some fled as long ago as 1967 but confirmed cumulative figures do not go back beyond 2006) (2013);;
226;Yemen;North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. The British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became South Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement and brief civil war in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed to a delimitation of their border. Fighting in the northwest between the government and the Huthis, a Zaydi Shia minority, began in 2004 and has since resulted in six rounds of fighting - the last ended in early 2010 with a cease-fire that continues to hold. The southern secessionist movement was revitalized in 2008 when a popular socioeconomic protest movement initiated the prior year took on political goals including secession. Public rallies in Sana'a against then President SALIH - inspired by similar demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt - slowly built momentum starting in late January 2011 fueled by complaints over high unemployment, poor economic conditions, and corruption. By the following month, some protests had resulted in violence, and the demonstrations had spread to other major cities. By March the opposition had hardened its demands and was unifying behind calls for SALIH's immediate ouster, and prominent military and tribal leaders began defecting from SALIH's camp. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in late April 2011, in an attempt to mediate the crisis in Yemen, proposed an agreement in which the president would step down in exchange for immunity from prosecution. SALIH's refusal to sign an agreement led to heavy street fighting and his injury in an explosion in June 2011. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2014 in October 2011 calling on both sides to end the violence and complete a power transfer deal. In late November 2011, SALIH signed the GCC-brokered agreement to step down and to transfer some of his powers to Vice President Abd Rabuh Mansur HADI. Following elections in February 2012, won by HADI, SALIH formally transferred his powers. In accordance with the GCC initiative, Yemen launched a National Dialogue in March 2013 to discuss key constitutional, political, and social issues. HADI concluded the National Dialogue in January 2014. Subsequent steps in the transition process include constitutional drafting, a constitutional referendum, and national elections.;;Middle East, bordering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea,

Petroleum accounts for roughly 25% of GDP and 63% of government revenue. Yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources and continuing attacks on its oil pipelines by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment. In October 2009, Yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort. In January 2010, the international community established the Friends of Yemen group that aims to support Yemen's efforts toward economic and political reform. In 2012, the Friends of Yemen pledged nearly $7 billion in assistance to Yemen. The Yemeni Government also endorsed a Mutual Accountability Framework to facilitate the efficient implementation of donor aid. The unrest that began in early 2011 caused GDP to plunge almost 11% in 2011. Availability of basic services, including electricity, water, and fuel, has improved since the transition, but progress toward achieving more sustainable economic stability has been slow and uneven. Yemen continues to face difficult long-term challenges, including declining water resources, high unemployment, severe food scarcity, and a high population growth rate.;$61.63 billion (2013 est.)<br

227;Bermuda;Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English colonists headed for Virginia. Self-governing since 1620, Bermuda is the oldest and most populous of the British overseas territories. Vacationing to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has also developed into a highly successful offshore financial center.

The average cost of a single-family home in 2012 was $1.1 million. Its economy is primarily based on international business and the provision of financial services to that sector, and to a lesser extent tourism. A number of reinsurance companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US and again after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005, contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector. Bermuda's tourism industry - which derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle and has dropped in its relevant importance to the economy, although it is still important as a job creator. Bermuda must import almost everything.

Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian merchandise exports each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power. Given its abundant natural resources, highly skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the world, owing to the financial sector's tradition of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. Canada achieved marginal growth in 2010-13 and plans to balance the budget by 2015. In addition, the country's petroleum sector is rapidly expanding, because Alberta's oil sands significantly boosted Canada's proven oil reserves. Canada now ranks third in the world in proved oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.;$1.518 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$1.494 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$1.469 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$1.825 trillion (2013 est.);1.6% (2013 est.)<br />1.7% (2012 est.)<br />2.5% (2011 est.);$43,100 (2013 est.)<br />$42,900 (2012 est.)<br />$42,700 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;21.5% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />21.2% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />21.1% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>55.8%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>21.6%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>24.6%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>0.2%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>30.1%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-32.3%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>1.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>28.4%<br /><i>services: </i>69.9% (2013 est.);wheat, barley, oilseed, tobacco, fruits, vegetables;transportation equipment, chemicals, processed and unprocessed minerals, food products, wood and paper products, fish products, petroleum, natural gas;1.4% (2013 est.);19.08 million (2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>2%<br /><i>manufacturing: </i>13%<br /><i>construction: </i>6%<br /><i>services: </i>76%<br /><i>other: </i>3% (2006 est.);7.1% (2013 est.)<br />7.3% (2012 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.6%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>24.8% (2000);9.4%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>this figure is the Low Income Cut-Off (LICO), a calculation that results in higher figures than found in many comparable economies;32.1 (2005)<br />31.5 (1994);<i>revenues: </i>$687.8 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$740.8 billion (2013 est.);37.7% of GDP (2013 est.);-2.9% of GDP (2013 est.);86.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />85.4% of GDP (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>figures are for gross general government debt, as opposed to net federal debt;1 April -

The subsidy was budgeted to be about $651 million in 2012, approximately 56% of government revenues that year. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's economy. Greenland's real GDP contracted about 1% in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown, but is estimated to have grown marginally in 2010-13. The relative ease with which Greenland has weathered the economic crisis is due to increased hydrocarbon and mineral exploration and extraction activities, a high level of construction activity in the Nuuk area and the increasing price of fish and shrimp. During the last decade the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has increased for better schools, health care and retirement systems. The Greenlandic economy has benefited from increasing catches and exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due to Greenland's continued dependence on exports of fish - which accounted for 89% of exports in 2010 - the economy remains very sensitive to foreign developments. International consortia are increasingly active in exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's western coast, and international studies indicate the potential for oil and gas fields in northern and northeastern Greenland. In May 2007 a US aluminum producer concluded a memorandum of understanding with the Greenland Home Rule Government to build an aluminum smelter and a power generation facility, which takes advantage of Greenland's abundant hydropower potential. Within the area of mining, olivine sand continues to be produced and gold production has resumed in south Greenland, while rare-earth and iron ore mineral projects have been proposed or planned elsewhere on the island. Tourism also offers another avenue of economic growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during the peak summer tourism season.;$2.133 billion (2011 est.)<br />$2.071 billion (2010 est.)<br />$1.974 billion (2009 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2011 US dollars;$2.16 billion (2011 est.);3% (2011 est.)<br />4.9% (2010 est.)<br />-2.7% (2009 est.);$38,400 (2008 est.)<br />$36,600 (2007 est.);;;<i>agriculture: </i>4%<br /><i>industry: </i>29%<br /><i>services: </i>67% (2009 est.);forage crops, garden and greenhouse vegetables;fish processing (mainly shrimp and Greenland halibut);NA%;28,600 (2011);<i>agriculture: </i>4%<br /><i>industry: </i>29%<br /><i>services: </i>67% (2009 est.);9.4% (2013 est.)<br />4.2% (2010 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;9.2% (2007 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$1.72 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$1.68 billion (2010);79.6% of GDP (2010);1.9% of GDP (2010);;calendar year;2.8% (2011 est.)<br />1.7% (2010 est.);;;;;;;;$384.3 million (2010)<br />$358 million (2009);fish and fish products 89%, metals 10% (2008);Denmark 60.4%, Japan 14.6%, China 7.9% (2012);$814.2 million (2010)<br />$726 million (2009);machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, food, petroleum products;Denmark 65.4%, Sweden 17.5%, Netherlands 5.5% (2012);;$36.4 million (2010)<br />$58 million (2009);;;Danish kroner (DKK) per US dollar -<br />5.695 (2011)<br />5.6241 (2012)<br />5.6241 (2010)<br />5.361 (2009)<br />5.0236 (2008);;276.6 million kWh (2010 est.);279 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);137,000 kW (2010 est.);100% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);3,897 bbl/day (2011 est.);920 bbl/day (2010 est.);5,164 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);611,100 Mt (2011 est.);18,900 (2012);59,455 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>adequate domestic and international service provided by satellite, cables and microwave radio relay;the Greenland Broadcasting Company provides public radio and TV services throughout the island with a broadcast station and a series of repeaters;.gl;15,645 (2012);36,000 (2009);;15 (2013);<i>total: </i>10<br /><i>2,438 to 3,047 m: </i>2<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>6 (2013);<i>total: </i>5<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>2<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>2 (2013);;;;<i><b>note:</b> </i>although there are short roads in towns, there are no roads between towns;;<i>registered in other countries: </i>1 (Denmark 1) (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Sisimiut;;no regular military forces;;<i>males age 16-49: </i>15,280 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>10,765<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>11,399 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>488<br /><i>female: </i>478 (2010 est.);;defense is the responsibility of Denmark;managed dispute between Canada and Denmark over Hans Island in the Kennedy Channel between Canada's Ellesmere Island and Greenland;;;
231;Mexico;The site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations - including the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec - Mexico was conquered and colonized by Spain in the early 16th century. Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three centuries, it achieved its independence early in the 19th century. The global financial crisis beginning in late 2008 caused a massive economic downturn the following year, although growth returned quickly in 2010. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, underemployment for a large segment of the population, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in the impoverished southern states. The elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PENA NIETO regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful drug-trafficking organizations have engaged in bloody feuding, resulting in tens of thousands of drug-related homicides.;;North America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and

233;United States;Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology.;;North America, bordering both the North Atlantic

234;Argentina;In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from throughout Europe, with Italy and Spain providing the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) by force, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations of several presidents. In January 2013, Argentina assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2013-14 term.;;Southern South America, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Chile and Uruguay;34 00 S, 64 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>2,780,400 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>2,736,690 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>43,710 sq km;slightly less than three-tenths the size of the US<br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/pdf/../../areacomparison/AR_area%202014.jpg">Area comparison map</a>;<i>total: </i>11,968 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Bolivia 942 km, Brazil 1,263 km, Chile 6,691 km, Paraguay 2,531 km, Uruguay 541 km;4,989 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin;mostly temperate;rich plains of the Pampas in northern half, flat to rolling plateau of Patagonia in south, rugged Andes along western border;<i>lowest point: </i>Laguna del Carbon -105 m (located between Puerto San Julian and Comandante Luis Piedra Buena in the province of Santa Cruz)<br /><i>highest point: </i>Cerro Aconcagua 6,960 m (located in the northwestern corner of the province of Mendoza;fertile plains of the pampas, lead, zinc, tin, copper, iron ore, manganese, petroleum, uranium;<i>arable land: </i>13.68%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.36%<br /><i>other: </i>85.96% (2011);15,500 sq km (2003);814 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>32.57 cu km/yr (23%/13%/64%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>864.9 cu m/yr (2005);San Miguel de Tucuman and Mendoza areas in the Andes subject to earthquakes;environmental problems (urban and rural) typical of an industrializing economy such as deforestation, soil degradation, desertification, air pollution, and water pollution<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>Argentina is a world leader in setting voluntary greenhouse gas targets;<i>party to: </i>Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Marine Life Conservation;second-largest country in South America (after Brazil);<i>noun: </i>Argentine(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Argentine;white (mostly Spanish and Italian) 97%, mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian ancestry), Amerindian, or other non-white groups 3%;Spanish (official), Italian, English, German, French, indigenous (Mapudungun, Quechua);nominally Roman Catholic 92% (less than 20% practicing), Protestant 2%, Jewish 2%, other 4%;Argentina's population continues to grow but at a slower rate because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina's fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s and then becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor. While the population under age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest in Argentina's history and will continue to bolster the working-age population. If this large working-age population is well-educated and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by region and socioeconomic group.<br />Argentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most of its history, welcoming European immigrants after its independence in the 19th century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and Italy. European immigration diminished in the 1950s, when Argentina's military dictatorships tightened immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional migration, however, continued to supply low-skilled workers and today it accounts for three-quarters of Argentina's immigrant population. The first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and 1970s. The ongoing European economic crisis is driving the return migration of some Argentinean and other Latin American nationals, as well as the immigration of Europeans to South America, where Argentina is a key recipient.;43,024,374 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>24.9% (male 5,486,989/female 5,233,968)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>15.7% (male 3,445,086/female 3,301,168)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>38.9% (male 8,345,893/female 8,391,445)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>9.1% (male 1,895,965/female 2,017,330)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>11.4% (male 2,036,545/female 2,869,985) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>54.1 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>37 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>17.1 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>5.9 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>31.2 years<br /><i>male: </i>30.1 years<br /><i>female: </i>32.3 years (2014 est.);0.95% (2014 est.);16.88 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);7.34 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>92.5% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.01% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);BUENOS AIRES (capital) 13.528 million;<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.97 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.7 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.97 male(s)/female (2014 est.);77 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>9.96 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>11.15 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>8.71 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>77.51 years<br /><i>male: </i>74.28 years<br /><i>female: </i>80.91 years (2014 est.);78.9% (2004/05);2.25 children born/woman (2014 est.);8.1% of GDP (2011);3.16 physicians/1,000 population (2004);4.5 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 99% of population<br />rural: 95.3% of population<br />total: 98.7% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 1% of population<br />rural: 4.7% of population<br />total: 1.3% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 97.1% of population<br />rural: 99.4% of population<br />total: 97.2% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 2.9% of population<br />rural: 0.6% of population<br />total: 2.8% of population (2012 est.);0.4% (2012 est.);97,900 (2012 est.);3,700 (2012 est.);;29.7% (2008);2.3% (2005);6.3% of GDP (2011);<i>definition: </i>age 10 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>97.9%<br /><i>male: </i>97.8%<br /><i>female: </i>97.9% (2011 est.);<i>total: </i>17 years<br /><i>male: </i>16 years<br /><i>female: </i>18 years (2011);;<i>total: </i>18.3%<br /><i>male: </i>15.3%<br /><i>female: </i>23.1% (2011);;<i>total number: </i>435,252<br /><i>percentage: </i>7 %<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data represents children ages 5-13 (2003 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Argentine Republic<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Argentina<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republica Argentina<br /><i>local short form: </i>Argentina;;;republic;;<i>name: </i>Buenos Aires<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>34 35 S, 58 40 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-3 (2 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>none scheduled for 2014;23 provinces (provincias, singular -

Although one of the world's wealthiest countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt, and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external indebtedness, and an unprecedented bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - at the time the largest ever - on the government's foreign debt in December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002. The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions, and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in 2007, with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession. The economy in 2010 rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession, but has slowed since late 2011 even as the government continued to rely on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, which have kept inflation in the double digits. The government expanded state intervention in the economy throughout 2012. In May 2012 the Congress approved the nationalization of the oil company YPF from Spain's Repsol. The government expanded formal and informal measures to restrict imports during the year, including a requirement for pre-registration and pre-approval of all imports. In July 2012 the government also further tightened currency controls in an effort to bolster foreign reserves and stem capital flight. During 2013, the government continued with a mix expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and foreign exchange and imports controls to limit the drain in Central Bank foreign reserves, which nevertheless dropped US $12 billion during the year. GDP grew 3% and inflation remained steady at 25%, according to private estimates. In October 2013, the government settled long-standing international arbitral disputes (including with three US firms) dating back to before and following the 2002 Argentine financial crisis. In early 2014, the government embraced a series of more orthodox economic policies. It devalued the peso 20%, substantially tightened monetary and fiscal policies, and took measures to mend ties with the international financial community, including: engaging with the IMF to improve its economic data reporting, reaching a compensation agreement with Repsol for the expropriation of YPF, and presenting a proposal to pay its arrears to the Paris Club.;$771 billion (2013 est.)<br

Bolivia's income inequality is the highest in Latin America and one of the highest in the world. Public education is of poor quality, and educational opportunities are among the most unevenly distributed in Latin America, with girls and indigenous and rural children less likely to be literate or to complete primary school. The lack of access to education and family planning services helps to sustain Bolivia's high fertility rate - approximately three children per woman.

However, the country remains one of the least developed countries in Latin America because of state-oriented policies that deter investment and growth. Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large Northern Hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange for a predetermined service fee. The global recession slowed growth, but Bolivia recorded the highest growth rate in South America during 2009. High commodity prices since 2010 sustained rapid growth and large trade surpluses. However, a lack of foreign investment in the key sectors of mining and hydrocarbons, along with conflict among social groups pose challenges for the Bolivian economy.;$59.11 billion (2013 est.)<br

Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until populist leader Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than a half century of populist and military government until 1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's leading economic power and a regional leader, one of the first in the area to begin an economic recovery. High income inequality and crime remain pressing problems, as well as recent years' slow down in economic growth.;;Eastern South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean;10 00 S, 55 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>8,514,877 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>8,459,417 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>55,460 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Arquipelago de Fernando de Noronha, Atol das Rocas, Ilha da Trindade, Ilhas Martin Vaz, and Penedos de Sao Pedro e Sao Paulo;slightly smaller than the US<br /><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/pdf/../../areacomparison/BR_area%202014.jpg">Area comparison map</a>;<i>total: </i>16,145 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Argentina 1,263 km, Bolivia 3,403 km, Colombia 1,790 km, French Guiana 649 km, Guyana 1,308 km, Paraguay 1,371 km, Peru 2,659 km, Suriname 515 km, Uruguay 1,050 km, Venezuela 2,137 km;7,491 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 nm or to edge of the continental margin;mostly tropical, but temperate in south;mostly flat to rolling lowlands in north;<i>lowest point: </i>Atlantic Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Pico da Neblina 2,994 m;bauxite, gold, iron ore, manganese, nickel, phosphates, platinum, tin, rare earth elements, uranium, petroleum, hydropower, timber;<i>arable land: </i>8.45%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.83%<br /><i>other: </i>90.72% (2011);54,000 sq km (2011);8,233 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>58.07 cu km/yr (28%/17%/55%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>306 cu m/yr (2006);recurring droughts in northeast;deforestation in Amazon Basin destroys the habitat and endangers a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous to the area;<i>party to: </i>Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;largest country in South America and in the Southern Hemisphere;<i>noun: </i>Brazilian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Brazilian;white 47.7%, mulatto (mixed white and black) 43.1%, black 7.6%, Asian 1.1%, indigenous 0.4% (2010 est.);Portuguese (official and most widely spoken language)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>less common languages include Spanish (border areas and schools), German, Italian, Japanese, English, and a large number of minor Amerindian languages;Roman Catholic 64.6%, other Catholic 0.4%, Protestant 22.2% (includes Adventist 6.5%, Assembly of God 2.0%, Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%, Universal Kingdom of God 1.0%, other Protestant 11.5%), other Christian 0.7%, Spiritist 2.2%, other 1.4%, none 8%, unspecified 0.4% (2010 est.);Brazil's rapid fertility decline since the 1960s is the main factor behind the country's slowing population growth rate, aging population, and fast-paced demographic transition.

Since 2003, Brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. In 2008, Brazil became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt. After strong growth in 2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery. In 2010, consumer and investor confidence revived and GDP growth reached 7.5%, the highest growth rate in the past 25 years.

237;Chile;Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the Inca ruled northern Chile while the Mapuche inhabited central and southern Chile. Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche were brought under central government control. After a series of elected governments, the three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely elected president was inaugurated in 1990. Sound economic policies, maintained consistently since the 1980s, contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and helped secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation. In January 2014, Chile assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2014-15 term.;;Southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Argentina and Peru;30 00 S, 71 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>756,102 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>743,812 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>12,290 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Easter Island (Isla de Pascua) and Isla Sala y Gomez;slightly smaller than twice the size of Montana;<i>total: </i>7,801 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Argentina 6,691 km, Bolivia 942 km, Peru 168 km;6,435 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>contiguous zone: </i>24 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200/350 nm;temperate;low coastal mountains;<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Nevado Ojos del Salado 6,880 m;copper, timber, iron ore, nitrates, precious metals, molybdenum, hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>1.74%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.6%<br /><i>other: </i>97.65% (2011);11,990 sq km (2003);922 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>26.67 cu km/yr (4%/10%/86%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>1,603 cu m/yr (2007);severe earthquakes;widespread deforestation and mining threaten natural resources;<i>party to: </i>Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;the longest north-south trending country in the world, extending across 38 degrees of latitude;<i>noun: </i>Chilean(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Chilean;white and non-indigenous 88.9%, Mapuche 9.1%, Aymara 0.7%, other indigenous groups 1% (includes Rapa Nui, Likan Antai, Quechua, Colla, Diaguita, Kawesqar, Yagan or Yamana), unspecified 0.3% (2012 est.);Spanish 99.5% (official), English 10.2%, indigenous 1% (includes Mapudungun, Aymara, Quechua, Rapa Nui), other 2.3%, unspecified 0.2%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>shares sum to more than 100% because some respondents gave more than one answer on the census (2012 est.);Roman Catholic 66.7%, Evangelical or Protestant 16.4%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1%, other 3.4%, none 11.5%, unspecified 1.1% (2012 est.);Chile is in the advanced stages of demographic transition and is becoming an aging society - with fertility below replacement level, low mortality rates, and life expectancy on par with developed countries. Nevertheless, with its dependency ratio nearing its low point, Chile could benefit from its favorable age structure. It will need to keep its large working-age population productively employed, while preparing to provide for the needs of its growing proportion of elderly people, especially as women - the traditional caregivers - increasingly enter the workforce. Over the last two decades, Chile has made great strides in reducing its poverty rate, which is now lower than most Latin American countries. However, its severe income inequality ranks as the worst among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Unequal access to quality education perpetuates this uneven income distribution.<br />Chile has historically been a country of emigration but has slowly become more attractive to immigrants since transitioning to democracy in 1990 and improving its economic stability (other regional destinations have concurrently experienced deteriorating economic and political conditions).

Exports of goods and services account for approximately one-third of GDP, with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides 19% of government revenue. From 2003 through 2013, real growth averaged almost 5% per year, despite the slight contraction in 2009 that resulted from the global financial crisis. Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January 2004. Chile has 22 trade agreements covering 60 countries including agreements with the European Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. Chile has joined the United States and nine other countries in negotiating the Trans-Pacific-Partnership trade agreement. The Chilean Government has generally followed a countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and generally allowing deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and growth. As of 31 December 2012, those sovereign wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $20.9 billion. Chile used these funds to finance fiscal stimulus packages during the 2009 economic downturn. In May 2010 Chile signed the OECD Convention, becoming the first South American country to join the OECD.;$335.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$321.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$304.2 billion (2011 est.)<br

238;Colombia;Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and Venezuela). A nearly five-decade long conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade, escalated during the 1990s. More than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006 and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia as a formal organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members include some former paramilitaries. The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government, but continue attacks against civilians. Large areas of the countryside are under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. In November 2012, the Colombian Government started formal peace negotiations with the FARC aimed at reaching a definitive bilateral ceasefire and incorporating demobilized FARC members into mainstream society and politics. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative departments. Despite decades of internal conflict and drug related security challenges, Colombia maintains relatively strong democratic institutions characterized by peaceful, transparent elections and the protection of civil liberties.;;Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Panama and Venezuela, and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Ecuador and Panama;4 00 N, 72 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>1,138,910 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>1,038,700 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>100,210 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Isla de Malpelo, Roncador Cay, and Serrana Bank;slightly less than twice the size of Texas;<i>total: </i>6,672 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Brazil 1,790 km, Ecuador 708 km, Panama 339 km, Peru 1,494 km, Venezuela 2,341 km;3,208 km (Caribbean Sea 1,760 km, North Pacific Ocean 1,448 km);<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 m depth or to the depth of exploitation;tropical along coast and eastern plains;flat coastal lowlands, central highlands, high Andes Mountains, eastern lowland plains (Llanos);<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Pico Cristobal Colon 5,775 m<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>nearby Pico Simon Bolivar also has the same elevation;petroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore, nickel, gold, copper, emeralds, hydropower;<i>arable land: </i>1.84%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>1.66%<br /><i>other: </i>96.5% (2011);10,870 sq km (2011);2,132 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>12.65 cu km/yr (55%/4%/41%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>308 cu m/yr (2010);highlands subject to volcanic eruptions;deforestation;<i>party to: </i>Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>Law of the Sea;only South American country with coastlines on both the North Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea;<i>noun: </i>Colombian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Colombian;mestizo 58%, white 20%, mulatto 14%, black 4%, mixed black-Amerindian 3%, Amerindian 1%;Spanish (official);Roman Catholic 90%, other 10%;Colombia is in the midst of a demographic transition resulting from steady declines in its fertility, mortality, and population growth rates.

Real GDP has grown more than 4% per year for the past three years, continuing almost a decade of strong economic performance. All three major ratings agencies have upgraded Colombia's government debt to investment grade. Nevertheless, Colombia depends heavily on energy and mining exports, making it vulnerable to a drop in commodity prices. Colombia is the world's fourth largest coal exporter and Latin Americaâ€™s fourth largest oil producer. Economic development is stymied by inadequate infrastructure and an uncertain security situation. Moreover, the unemployment rate of 9.7% in 2013 is still one of Latin America's highest.

Nevertheless, the conditional cash transfer program, which requires participants' children to attend school and have medical check-ups, has helped improve educational attainment and healthcare among poor children. Ecuador is stalled at above replacement level fertility and the population most likely will keep growing rather than stabilize.<br />An estimated 2 to 3 million Ecuadorians live abroad, but increased unemployment in key receiving countries - Spain, the United States, and Italy - is slowing emigration and increasing the likelihood of returnees to Ecuador. The first large-scale emigration of Ecuadorians occurred between 1980 and 2000, when an economic crisis drove Ecuadorians from southern provinces to New York City, where they had trade contacts. A second, nationwide wave of emigration in the late 1990s was caused by another economic downturn, political instability, and a currency crisis.

In 1999/2000, Ecuador's economy suffered from a banking crisis, with GDP contracting by 5.3% and poverty increasing significantly. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From 2002-06 the economy grew an average of 4.3% per year, the highest five-year average in 25 years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth rate of 6.4% in 2008, buoyed by high global petroleum prices and increased public sector investment. President Rafael CORREA Delgado, who took office in January 2007, defaulted in December 2008 on Ecuador's sovereign debt, which, with a total face value of approximately US$3.2 billion, represented about 30% of Ecuador's public external debt.

240;Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas);Although first sighted by an English navigator in 1592, the first landing (English) did not occur until almost a century later in 1690, and the first settlement (French) was not established until 1764. The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute, first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced an Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982. With hostilities ended and Argentine forces withdrawn, UK administration resumed. In response to renewed calls from Argentina for Britain to relinquish control of the islands, a referendum was held in March 2013, which resulted in 99.8% of the population voting to remain a part of the UK.;;Southern South America, islands in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 500 km east of southern Argentina;51 45 S, 59 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>12,173 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>12,173 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes the two main islands of East and West Falkland and about 200 small islands;slightly smaller than Connecticut;0 km;1,288 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 nm<br /><i>exclusive fishing zone: </i>200 nm;cold marine;rocky, hilly, mountainous with some boggy, undulating plains;<i>lowest point: </i>Atlantic Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Mount Usborne 705 m;fish, squid, wildlife, calcified seaweed, sphagnum moss;<i>arable land: </i>0%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0%<br /><i>other: </i>100% (99% permanent pastures, 1% other) (2011);NA;;;strong winds persist throughout the year;overfishing by unlicensed vessels is a problem;;deeply indented coast provides good natural harbors;<i>noun: </i>Falkland Islander(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Falkland Island;Falkland Islander 57%, British 24.6%, St. Helenian 9.8%, Chilean 5.3%, other 3.4% (2012 est.);English 89%, Spanish 7.7%, other 3.3% (2006 est.);Christian 66%, none 32%, other 2% (2012 est.);;2,840 (July 2012 est.);;;;0.01% (2009 est.);NA;;NA;<i>urban population: </i>74.1% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>0.92% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);STANLEY (capital) 2,000 (2011);<i>total population: </i>1.11 male(s)/female<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>sex ratio is somewhat skewed by the high proportion of males at the Royal Air Force station, Mount Pleasant Airport (MPA);;<i>total: </i>NA<br /><i>male: </i>NA<br /><i>female: </i>NA;<i>total population: </i>NA<br /><i>male: </i>NA<br /><i>female: </i>NA;;NA;;;;;;NA;NA;NA;;;;;NA;;;;;;<i>conventional long form: </i>none<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas);;overseas territory of the UK;NA;;<i>name: </i>Stanley<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>51 42 S, 57 51 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-4 (1 hour ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>none scheduled for 2014;none (overseas territory of the UK;;;none (overseas territory of the UK;Liberation Day, 14 June (1982);previous 1985;English common law and local statutes;;18 years of age;<i>chief of state: </i>Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952)<br /><i>head of government: </i>Governor Nigel HAYWOOD (since 16 October 2010) is the Queen's representative;unicameral Legislative Assembly (10 seats;<i>highest court(s): </i>Court of Appeal (consists of the court president, the chief justice as an ex officio, non-resident member, and 2 justices of appeal);none;Falkland Islands Association (supports freedom of the people from external causes);UPU;none (overseas territory of the UK);none (overseas territory of the UK;blue with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side quadrant and the Falkland Island coat of arms centered on the outer half of the flag;ram;<i>name: </i>&quot;;The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep farming but fishing and tourism currently comprise the bulk of economic activity.

241;Guyana;Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to settlement of urban areas by former slaves and the importation of indentured servants from India to work the sugar plantations. The resulting ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is considered the country's first free and fair election since independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001 and again in 2006.

The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily in the raw materials sector. Guyana has experienced positive growth almost every year over the past decade. Inflation has been kept under control. Recent years have seen the government's stock of debt reduced significantly - with external debt now less than half of what it was in the early 1990s. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labor and a deficient infrastructure. Despite recent improvements, the government is still juggling a sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank, Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million debt, equivalent to 21% of GDP, which along with other Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 60% in 2013. Guyana had become heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Much of Guyana's growth in recent years has come from a surge in gold production in response to global prices, although downward trends in gold prices may threaten future growth. In 2013, production of sugar dropped to a 23-year low.;$6.593 billion (2013 est.)<br />$6.26 billion (2012 est.)<br />$5.972 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$3.02 billion (2013 est.);5.3% (2013 est.)<br />4.8% (2012 est.)<br />5.4% (2011 est.);$8,500 (2013 est.)<br />$8,100 (2012 est.)<br />$7,700 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;6.2% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />8.3% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />9.4% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>85.6%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>16.3%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>22.5%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>-13.5%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>59.9%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-70.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>20.7%<br /><i>industry: </i>38.5%<br /><i>services: </i>40.8% (2013 est.);sugarcane, rice, edible oils;bauxite, sugar, rice milling, timber, textiles, gold mining;13.5% (2013 est.);313,100 (2009 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>NA%<br /><i>industry: </i>NA%<br /><i>services: </i>NA%;11% (2007);<i>lowest 10%: </i>1.3%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>33.8% (1999);35% (2006);44.6 (2007)<br />43.2 (1999);<i>revenues: </i>$756.7 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$948.5 million (2013 est.);25.1% of GDP (2013 est.);-6.4% of GDP (2013 est.);59.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />59.5% of GDP (2012 est.);calendar year;3.9% (2013 est.)<br />2.4% (2012 est.);5.5% (31 December 2011 est.)<br />4.25% (31 December 2010 est.);13.8% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />13.86% (31 December 2012 est.);$601.8 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$550.4 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.617 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.49 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$1.352 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.223 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$610.9 million (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$440.4 million (31 December 2011)<br />$NA (31 December 2010 est.);-$510.7 million (2013 est.)<br />-$394.8 million (2012 est.);$1.337 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.396 billion (2012 est.);sugar, gold, bauxite, alumina, rice, shrimp, molasses, rum, timber;US 30.8%, Canada 28.9%, UK 6.2% (2012);$2.039 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.978 billion (2012 est.);manufactures, machinery, petroleum, food;US 22.2%, Trinidad and Tobago 21.9%, China 12.3%, Cuba 6.1%, Suriname 4% (2012);$854.7 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$864 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.846 billion (31 December 2011 est.)<br />$1.846 billion (31 December 2011 est.);;;Guyanese dollars (GYD) per US dollar -<br />205.9 (2013 est.)<br />204.36 (2012 est.)<br />203.64 (2010 est.)<br />203.95 (2009)<br />203.86 (2008);;700 million kWh (2010 est.);512 million kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);362,500 kW (2010 est.);96% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0.3% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);3.7% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);10,910 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);10,780 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);1.673 million Mt (2011 est.);154,200 (2012);547,000 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>fair system for long-distance service;government-dominated broadcast media;.gy;24,936 (2012);189,600 (2009);;117 (2013);<i>total: </i>11<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>2<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>8 (2013);<i>total: </i>106<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>16<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>89 (2013);;;;<i>total: </i>7,970 km<br /><i>paved: </i>590 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>7,380 km (2000);330 km (the Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo rivers are navigable by oceangoing vessels for 150 km, 100 km, and 80 km respectively) (2012);<i>total: </i>10<br /><i>by type: </i>cargo 7, petroleum tanker 2, refrigerated cargo 1<br /><i>registered in other countries: </i>3 (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 2, unknown 1) (2010);<i>major seaport(s): </i>Georgetown;;Guyana Defense Force: Army (includes Air Corps, Coast Guard) (2012);18 years of age or older for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>189,840 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>133,239<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>147,719 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>8,849<br /><i>female: </i>8,460 (2010 est.);1.09% of GDP (2012)<br />1.17% of GDP (2011)<br />1.09% of GDP (2010);;all of the area west of the Essequibo River is claimed by Venezuela preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary;;<i>current situation: </i>Guyana is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor;transshipment point for narcotics from South America - primarily Venezuela - to Europe and the US

In the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70) - between Paraguay and Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay - Paraguay lost two-thirds of its adult males and much of its territory. The country stagnated economically for the next half century. Following the Chaco War of 1932-35 with Bolivia, Paraguay gained a large part of the Chaco lowland region.

The fertility rate continues to drop, declining sharply from an average 4.3 births per woman in the late 1990s to about 2 in 2013, as a result of the greater educational attainment of women, increased use of contraception, and a desire for smaller families among young women.<br />Paraguay is a country of emigration;6,703,860 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>26.2% (male 892,315/female 861,915)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>20.5% (male 691,365/female 683,653)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>39.5% (male 1,326,281/female 1,323,194)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>7.2% (male 246,869/female 236,564)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>6.4% (male 206,089/female 235,615) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>60.5 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>51.5 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>8.9 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>11.2 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>26.8 years<br /><i>male: </i>26.6 years<br /><i>female: </i>27 years (2014 est.);1.19% (2014 est.);16.66 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);4.64 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-0.08 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>61.9% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>2.55% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);ASUNCION (capital) 2.139 million (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.01 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>1.01 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.87 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>1.01 male(s)/female (2014 est.);99 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>20.75 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>24.39 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>16.93 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>76.8 years<br /><i>male: </i>74.16 years<br /><i>female: </i>79.56 years (2014 est.);79.4%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>percent of women aged 15-44 (2008);1.96 children born/woman (2014 est.);9.7% of GDP (2011);1.11 physicians/1,000 population (2002);1.3 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 100% of population<br />rural: 83.4% of population<br />total: 93.8% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 0% of population<br />rural: 16.6% of population<br />total: 6.2% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 96.1% of population<br />rural: 52.5% of population<br />total: 79.7% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 3.9% of population<br />rural: 47.5% of population<br />total: 20.3% of population (2012 est.);0.3% (2012 est.);13,100 (2012 est.);300 (2012 est.);<i>degree of risk: </i>intermediate<br /><i>food or waterborne diseases: </i>bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever<br /><i>vectorborne disease: </i>dengue fever (2013);17.9% (2008);3.4% (2005);4.8% of GDP (2011);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>93.9%<br /><i>male: </i>94.8%<br /><i>female: </i>92.9% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>13 years<br /><i>male: </i>12 years<br /><i>female: </i>13 years (2011);22.9<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>median age at first birth among women 25-29 (2008 est.);<i>total: </i>11.2%<br /><i>male: </i>9%<br /><i>female: </i>14.6% (2012);;<i>total number: </i>205,297<br /><i>percentage: </i>15 % (2004 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of Paraguay<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Paraguay<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republica del Paraguay<br /><i>local short form: </i>Paraguay;;;constitutional republic;;<i>name: </i>Asuncion<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>25 16 S, 57 40 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-4 (1 hour ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>+1hr, begins first Sunday in October;17 departments (departamentos, singular -

A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession. The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at a 13% level in 2010, the highest in South America, but slowed in 2011-12 as the stimulus subsided and severe drought and outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease led to a drop in beef and other agricultural exports. The economy took another leap in 2013, largely due to strong export growth. Political uncertainty, corruption, limited progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the main obstacles to long-term growth.;$45.9 billion (2013 est.)<br />$40.98 billion (2012

243;Peru;Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his resignation in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001, which installed Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of indigenous ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990, oversaw a robust economic rebound. In June 2011, former army officer Ollanta HUMALA Tasso was elected president, defeating Keiko FUJIMORI Higuchi, the daughter of Alberto FUJIMORI. Since his election, HUMALA has carried on the sound, market-oriented economic policies of the three preceding administrations.;;Western South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Chile and Ecuador;10 00 S, 76 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>1,285,216 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>1,279,996 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>5,220 sq km;slightly smaller than Alaska;<i>total: </i>7,461 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Bolivia 1,075 km, Brazil 2,995 km, Chile 171 km, Colombia 1,800 km, Ecuador 1,420 km;2,414 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>200 nm<br /><i>continental shelf: </i>200 nm;varies from tropical in east to dry desert in west;western coastal plain (costa), high and rugged Andes in center (sierra), eastern lowland jungle of Amazon Basin (selva);<i>lowest point: </i>Pacific Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Nevado Huascaran 6,768 m;copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydropower, natural gas;<i>arable land: </i>2.84%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.66%<br /><i>other: </i>96.5% (2011);11,960 sq km (2003);1,913 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>19.34 cu km/yr (8%/10%/82%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>727.6 cu m/yr (2005);earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, landslides, mild volcanic activity<br /><i>volcanism: </i>volcanic activity in the Andes Mountains;deforestation (some the result of illegal logging);<i>party to: </i>Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;shares control of Lago Titicaca, world's highest navigable lake, with Bolivia;<i>noun: </i>Peruvian(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Peruvian;Amerindian 45%, mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 37%, white 15%, black, Japanese, Chinese, and other 3%;Spanish (official) 84.1%, Quechua (official) 13%, Aymara (official) 1.7%, Ashaninka 0.3%, other native languages (includes a large number of minor Amazonian languages) 0.7%, other (includes foreign languages and sign language) 0.2% (2007 est.);Roman Catholic 81.3%, Evangelical 12.5%, other 3.3%, none 2.9% (2007 est.);Peru's urban and coastal communities have benefited much more from recent economic growth than rural, Afro-Peruvian, indigenous, and poor populations of the Amazon and mountain regions. The poverty rate has dropped substantially during the last decade but remains stubbornly high at about 30% (more than 55% in rural areas). After remaining almost static for about a decade, Peru's malnutrition rate began falling in 2005, when the government introduced a coordinated strategy focusing on hygiene, sanitation, and clean water. School enrollment has improved, but achievement scores reflect ongoing problems with educational quality. Many poor children temporarily or permanently drop out of school to help support their families. About a quarter to a third of Peruvian children aged 6 to 14 work, often putting in long hours at hazardous mining or construction sites.<br />Peru was a country of immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but has become a country of emigration in the last few decades. Beginning in the 19th century, Peru brought in Asian contract laborers mainly to work on coastal plantations. Populations of Chinese and Japanese descent - among the largest in Latin America - are economically and culturally influential in Peru today. Peruvian emigration began rising in the 1980s due to an economic crisis and a violent internal conflict, but outflows have stabilized in the last few years as economic conditions have improved. Nonetheless, more than 2 million Peruvians have emigrated in the last decade, principally to the US, Spain, and Argentina.;30,147,935 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>27.3% (male 4,184,330/female 4,040,096)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>19.2% (male 2,894,168/female 2,889,409)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>39.4% (male 5,715,542/female 6,161,540)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>7.3% (male 1,071,688/female 1,125,100)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>6.7% (male 979,854/female 1,086,208) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>53.7 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>43.6 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>10 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>10 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>27 years<br /><i>male: </i>26.3 years<br /><i>female: </i>27.7 years (2014 est.);0.99% (2014 est.);18.57 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);5.99 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-2.69 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>77.3% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.55% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);LIMA (capital) 9.13 million;<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>0.93 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.97 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.9 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.97 male(s)/female (2014 est.);67 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>20.21 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>22.44 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>17.88 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>73.23 years<br /><i>male: </i>71.23 years<br /><i>female: </i>75.33 years (2014 est.);68.9% (2011);2.22 children born/woman (2014 est.);4.8% of GDP (2011);0.92 physicians/1,000 population (2009);1.5 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 91.2% of population<br />rural: 71.6% of population<br />total: 86.8% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 8.8% of population<br />rural: 28.4% of population<br />total: 13.2% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 81.2% of population<br />rural: 44.8% of population<br />total: 73.1% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 18.8% of population<br />rural: 55.2% of population<br />total: 26.9% of population (2012 est.);0.4% (2012 est.);75,500 (2012 est.);4,100 (2012 est.);<i>degree of risk: </i>very high<br /><i>food or waterborne diseases: </i>bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever<br /><i>vectorborne disease: </i>dengue fever, malaria, and Bartonellosis (Oroya fever) (2013);15.7% (2008);4.5% (2008);2.8% of GDP (2012);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>89.6%<br /><i>male: </i>94.9%<br /><i>female: </i>84.6% (2007 est.);<i>total: </i>13 years<br /><i>male: </i>13 years<br /><i>female: </i>13 years (2010);22.2<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>median age at first birth among women 25-29 (2013 est.);<i>total: </i>9.5%<br /><i>male: </i>9.4%<br /><i>female: </i>9.7% (2011);;<i>total number: </i>2,545,855<br /><i>percentage: </i>34 %<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data represents children ages 5-17 (2007 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of Peru<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Peru<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republica del Peru<br /><i>local short form: </i>Peru;;;constitutional republic;;<i>name: </i>Lima<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>12 03 S, 77 03 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-5 (same time as Washington, DC, during Standard Time);25 regions (regiones, singular -

an arid lowland coastal region, the central high sierra of the Andes, the dense forest of the Amazon, with tropical lands bordering Colombia and Brazil. A wide range of important mineral resources are found in the mountainous and coastal areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent fishing grounds. Peru is the world's second largest producer of silver and third largest producer of copper. The Peruvian economy has been growing by an average of 5.6% for the past five years with a stable exchange rate and low inflation, which in 2013 was just below the upper limit of the Central Bank target range of 1 to 3%. For the last three years, this growth was due partly to high international prices for Peru's metals and minerals exports, which account for almost 60% of the country's total exports. Despite Peru's strong macroeconomic performance, dependence on minerals and metals exports and imported foodstuffs makes the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices. Peru's rapid expansion coupled with cash transfers and other programs have helped to reduce the national poverty rate by 28 percentage points since 2002, but inequality persists and continues to pose a challenge for the Ollanta HUMALA administration, which has championed a policy of social inclusion and a more equitable distribution of income. Poor infrastructure hinders the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal areas. Peru's free trade policy has continued under the HUMALA administration;$344 billion (2013 est.)<br />$327.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$308 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013

244;South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands;The islands, with large bird and seal populations, lie approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration since 1908 - except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina occupied them. Grytviken, on South Georgia, was a 19th and early 20th century whaling station. Famed explorer Ernest SHACKLETON stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated attempt to cross Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months later with a few companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue for the rest of his crew, stranded off the Antarctic Peninsula. He died in 1922 on a subsequent expedition and is buried in Grytviken. Today, the station houses scientists from the British Antarctic Survey. Recognizing the importance of preserving the marine stocks in adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993, extended the exclusive fishing zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around each island.;;Southern South America, islands in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of the tip of South America;54 30 S, 37 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>3,903 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>3,903 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>0 sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Shag Rocks, Black Rock, Clerke Rocks, South Georgia Island, Bird Island, and the South Sandwich Islands, which consist of 11 islands;slightly larger than Rhode Island;0 km;NA;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>exclusive fishing zone: </i>200 nm;variable, with mostly westerly winds throughout the year interspersed with periods of calm;most of the islands, rising steeply from the sea, are rugged and mountainous;<i>lowest point: </i>Atlantic Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Mount Paget (South Georgia) 2,934 m;fish;<i>arable land: </i>0%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0%<br /><i>other: </i>100% (largely covered by permanent ice and snow with some sparse vegetation consisting of grass, moss, and lichen) (2011);0 sq km (2011);;;the South Sandwich Islands have prevailing weather conditions that generally make them difficult to approach by ship;NA;;the north coast of South Georgia has several large bays, which provide good anchorage;;;;;;no indigenous inhabitants<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>the small military garrison on South Georgia withdrew in March 2001 replaced by a permanent group of scientists of the British Antarctic Survey, which also has a biological station on Bird Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;<i>conventional long form: </i>South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands<br /><i>abbreviation: </i>SGSSI;;overseas territory of the UK, also claimed by Argentina;;;;;;;;;;the laws of the UK where applicable apply;;;;;;;;;none (overseas territory of the UK, also claimed by Argentina);none (overseas territory of the UK, also claimed by Argentina);blue, with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side quadrant and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands coat of arms centered on the outer half of the flag;;;;Some fishing takes place in adjacent waters.

245;Suriname;First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became a Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of African slavery in 1863, workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a democratically elected government - a four-party coalition - returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005 and ruled until August 2010, when voters returned former military leader Desire BOUTERSE and his opposition coalition to power.;;Northern South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between French Guiana and Guyana;4 00 N, 56 00 W;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/south_america.pdf">South America</a>;<i>total: </i>163,820 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>156,000 sq km<br /><i>water: </i>7,820 sq km;slightly larger than Georgia;<i>total: </i>1,703 km<br /><i>border countries: </i>Brazil 593 km, French Guiana 510 km, Guyana 600 km;386 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>12 nm<br /><i>exclusive economic zone: </i>200 nm;tropical;mostly rolling hills;<i>lowest point: </i>unnamed location in the coastal plain -2 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>Juliana Top 1,230 m;timber, hydropower, fish, kaolin, shrimp, bauxite, gold, and small amounts of nickel, copper, platinum, iron ore;<i>arable land: </i>0.36%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0.04%<br /><i>other: </i>99.6% (2011);511.8 sq km (2003);122 cu km (2011);<i>total: </i>0.67 cu km/yr (6%/4%/90%)<br /><i>per capita: </i>1,396 cu m/yr (2006);NA;deforestation as timber is cut for export;<i>party to: </i>Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling<br /><i>signed, but not ratified: </i>none of the selected agreements;smallest independent country on South American continent;<i>noun: </i>Surinamer(s)<br /><i>adjective: </i>Surinamese;Hindustani (also known locally as &quot;Dutch (official), English (widely spoken), Sranang Tongo (Surinamese, sometimes called Taki-Taki, is native language of Creoles and much of the younger population and is lingua franca among others), Caribbean Hindustani (a dialect of Hindi), Javanese;Hindu 27.4%, Protestant 25.2% (predominantly Moravian), Roman Catholic 22.8%, Muslim 19.6%, indigenous beliefs 5%;Suriname is a pluralistic society consisting primarily of Creoles (persons of mixed African and European heritage), the descendants of escaped African slaves known as Maroons, and the descendants of Indian and Javanese contract workers. The country overall is in full, post-industrial demographic transition, with a low fertility rate, a moderate mortality rate, and a rising life expectancy. However, the Maroon population of the rural interior lags behind because of lower educational attainment and contraceptive use, higher malnutrition, and significantly less access to electricity, potable water, sanitation, infrastructure, and health care.<br />Some 350,000 people of Surinamese descent live in the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler. In the 19th century, better-educated, largely Dutch-speaking Surinamese began emigrating to the Netherlands. World War II interrupted the outflow, but it resumed after the war when Dutch labor demands grew - emigrants included all segments of the Creole population. Suriname still is strongly influenced by the Netherlands because most Surinamese have relatives living there and it is the largest supplier of development aid. Other emigration destinations include French Guiana and the United States. Suriname's immigration rules are flexible, and the country is easy to enter illegally because rainforests obscure its borders. Since the mid-1980s, Brazilians have settled in Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, or eastern Suriname, where they mine gold. This immigration is likely to slowly re-orient Suriname toward its Latin American roots.;573,311 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>26.2% (male 76,565/female 73,676)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>17.6% (male 51,322/female 49,313)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>44.1% (male 128,620/female 124,034)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>6.5% (male 18,140/female 19,158)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>5.6% (male 14,041/female 18,442) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>50.7 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>40.6 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>10.1 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>9.9 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>28.6 years<br /><i>male: </i>28.3 years<br /><i>female: </i>29 years (2014 est.);1.12% (2014 est.);16.73 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);6.13 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);0.57 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>69.7% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>1.44% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);PARAMARIBO (capital) 278,000 (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.05 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>1.01 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.77 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>1.01 male(s)/female (2014 est.);130 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>27.07 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>31.5 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>22.41 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>71.69 years<br /><i>male: </i>69.31 years<br /><i>female: </i>74.18 years (2014 est.);45.6% (2006);2.01 children born/woman (2014 est.);5.3% of GDP (2011);0.91 physicians/1,000 population (2004);3.1 beds/1,000 population (2010);<i>improved: </i>urban: 98.1% of population<br />rural: 88.4% of population<br />total: 95.2% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 1.9% of population<br />rural: 11.6% of population<br />total: 4.8% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 88.4% of population<br />rural: 61.4% of population<br />total: 80.3% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 11.6% of population<br />rural: 38.6% of population<br />total: 19.7% of population (2012 est.);1.1% (2012 est.);4,000 (2012 est.);100 (2012 est.);<i>degree of risk: </i>very high<br /><i>food or waterborne diseases: </i>bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever<br /><i>vectorborne disease: </i>dengue fever and malaria (2013);25.1% (2008);5.8% (2010);NA;<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>94.7%<br /><i>male: </i>95.4%<br /><i>female: </i>94% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>12 years<br /><i>male: </i>11 years<br /><i>female: </i>13 years (2002);;<i>total: </i>21.5% (2004);;<i>total number: </i>6,094<br /><i>percentage: </i>6 % (2006 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Republic of Suriname<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Suriname<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republiek Suriname<br /><i>local short form: </i>Suriname<br /><i>former: </i>Netherlands Guiana, Dutch Guiana;;;constitutional democracy;;<i>name: </i>Paramaribo<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>5 50 N, 55 10 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-3 (2 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time);10 districts (distrikten, singular - distrikt);;;25 November 1975 (from the Netherlands);Independence Day, 25 November (1975);previous 1975;civil law system influenced by Dutch civil law;accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations;18 years of age;<i>chief of state: </i>President Desire Delano BOUTERSE (since 12 August 2010);unicameral National Assembly or Nationale Assemblee (51 seats;<i>highest court(s): </i>High Court of Justice of Suriname (consists of the court president, vice president, and 4 judges)<br />note - Suriname can appeal beyond its High Court to the Caribbean Court of Justice, with final appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (in London)<br /><i>judge selection and term of office: </i>court judges appointed by the national president after consultation with the High Court;A-Combination (a coalition that includes the General Liberation and Development Party ABOP [Ronnie BRUNSWIJK], and SEEKA [Paul ABENA])<br />Basic Party for Renewal and Democracy or BVD [Dilip SARDJOE]<br />Basic Party for Renewal and Democracy or PVF [Soedeschand JAIRAM]<br />Democratic Union Suriname or DUS [Japhet DIEKO]<br />Mega Combination Coalition (a coalition that joined with A-Combination and the PL to form a majority in Parliament in 2010 - includes the National Democratic Party or NDP [Desire Delano BOUTERSE] (largest party in the coalition), Progressive Worker and Farmer's Union or PALU [Jim HOK], Party for National Unity and Solidarity of the Highest Order or KTPI [Willy SOEMITA], DNP-2000 [Jules WIJDENBOSCH], Union of Brotherhood and Unity in Politics BEP [Caprino ALENDY], and New Suriname or NS [Nanan PANDAY])<br />National Union or NU [P.

Economic growth has remained at about 4-5% per year in 2010-13, but the government's budget was strained by high inflation in 2010. In January 2011, the government devalued the currency by 20% and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit. As a result of these measures, inflation has receded to about 4% in 2013. Suriname's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition. The government's reliance on revenue from extractive industries will temper Suriname's economic outlook, especially if gold prices continue their downward trend.;$7.12 billion (2013 est.)<br />$6.801 billion (2012 est.)<br />$6.492 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$5.009 billion (2013 est.);4.7% (2013 est.)<br />4.8% (2012 est.)<br />4.7% (2011 est.);$12,900 (2013 est.)<br />$12,500 (2012 est.)<br />$12,100 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>73.8%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>9.9%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>5%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>19.7%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>43.2%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-51.6%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>8.9%<br /><i>industry: </i>36.6%<br /><i>services: </i>54.5% (2013 est.);rice, bananas, palm kernels, coconuts, plantains, peanuts;bauxite and gold mining, alumina production;4% (2013 est.);165,600 (2007);<i>agriculture: </i>8%<br /><i>industry: </i>14%<br /><i>services: </i>78% (2004);9% (2008)<br />12.1% (2006);<i>lowest 10%: </i>NA%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>NA%;70% (2002 est.);;<i>revenues: </i>$826.6 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$939.7 million (2010 est.);16.5% of GDP (2010 est.);-2.3% of GDP (2010 est.);;calendar year;4.2% (2013 est.)<br />5% (2012 est.);;12% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />11.73% (31 December 2012 est.);$1.132 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$1.075 billion (31 December 2011 est.);$3.005 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$2.463 million (31 December 2012 est.);$939.4 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.275 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$NA;$102.5 million (2013 est.)<br />$241.4 million (2012 est.);$2.512 billion (2013 est.)<br />$2.564 billion (2012 est.);alumina, gold, crude oil, lumber, shrimp and fish, rice, bananas;US 25.7%, Belgium 17.4%, UAE 11.5%, Canada 10.3%, Guyana 5.8%, France 5.5%, Barbados 4.2% (2012);$1.778 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.761 billion (2012 est.);capital equipment, petroleum, foodstuffs, cotton, consumer goods;US 26%, Netherlands 16%, China 9.9%, UAE 8.1%, Antigua and Barbuda 6.7%, Netherlands Antilles 4.9%, Japan 4.3% (2012);$1.008 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$816.9 million (31 December 2011 est.);$860 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$810.8 million (31 December 2012 est.);;;Surinamese dollars (SRD) per US dollar -<br />3.3 (2012 est.)<br />3.3 (2012 est.)<br />2.7454 (2010 est.)<br />2.745 (2009)<br />2.745 (2008);;1.57 billion kWh (2010 est.);1.423 billion kWh (2010 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);0 kWh (2012 est.);410,000 kW (2010 est.);53.9% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);46.1% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);15,270 bbl/day (2012 est.);7,621 bbl/day (2010 est.);0.66 bbl/day (2010 est.);76.8 million bbl (1 January 2013 est.);7,462 bbl/day (2010 est.);14,100 bbl/day (2011 est.);1,015 bbl/day (2010 est.);6,454 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2011 est.);2.335 million Mt (2011 est.);83,000 (2012);977,000 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>international facilities are good<br /><i>domestic: </i>combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity 185 telephones per 100 persons;2 state-owned TV stations;.sr;188 (2012);163,000 (2009);;55 (2013);<i>total: </i>6<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>5 (2013);<i>total: </i>49<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>4<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>45 (2013);;oil 50 km (2013);;<i>total: </i>4,304 km<br /><i>paved: </i>1,130 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>3,174 km (2003);1,200 km (most navigable by ships with drafts up to 7 m) (2011);;<i>major seaport(s): </i>Paramaribo, Wageningen;;Suriname Armed Forces: Ground Forces, Naval Forces, Air Forces (2010);18 is the legal minimum age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>134,218<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>134,439 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>109,445<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>112,538 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>4,119<br /><i>female: </i>4,106 (2010 est.);;;area claimed by French Guiana between Riviere Litani and Riviere Marouini (both headwaters of the Lawa);;<i>current situation: </i>Suriname is a source, destination, and transit country for women, men, and children who are subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor;growing transshipment point for South American drugs destined for Europe via the Netherlands and Brazil
246;Uruguay;Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold, soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an important commercial center. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century launched widespread political, social, and economic reforms that established a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold over the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center Frente Amplio Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170 years of political control previously held by the Colorado and Blanco parties.

It is one of the few countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where the entire population has access to clean water. Uruguay's provision of free primary through university education has contributed to the country's high levels of literacy and educational attainment. However, the emigration of human capital has diminished the state's return on its investment in education. Remittances from the roughly 18% of Uruguayans abroad amount to less than 1 percent of national GDP. The emigration of young adults and a low birth rate are causing Uruguay's population to age rapidly.<br />In the 1960s, Uruguayans for the first time emigrated en masse - primarily to Argentina and Brazil - because of economic decline and the onset of more than a decade of military dictatorship. Economic crises in the early 1980s and 2002 also triggered waves of emigration, but since 2002 more than 70% of Uruguayan emigrants have selected the US and Spain as destinations because of better job prospects. Uruguay had a tiny population upon its independence in 1828 and welcomed thousands of predominantly Italian and Spanish immigrants, but the country has not experienced large influxes of new arrivals since the aftermath of World War II. More recent immigrants include Peruvians and Arabs.;3,332,972 (July 2014 est.);<i>0-14 years: </i>21% (male 356,851/female 344,576)<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>16% (male 269,820/female 262,830)<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>38.9% (male 639,766/female 658,257)<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>10.1% (male 158,170/female 178,194)<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>13.9% (male 185,132/female 279,376) (2014 est.);<i>total dependency ratio: </i>55.9 %<br /><i>youth dependency ratio: </i>33.8 %<br /><i>elderly dependency ratio: </i>22.1 %<br /><i>potential support ratio: </i>4.5 (2014 est.);<i>total: </i>34.3 years<br /><i>male: </i>32.6 years<br /><i>female: </i>35.9 years (2014 est.);0.26% (2014 est.);13.18 births/1,000 population (2014 est.);9.48 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.);-1.08 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.);<i>urban population: </i>92.5% of total population (2011)<br /><i>rate of urbanization: </i>0.45% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.);MONTEVIDEO (capital) 1.672 million (2011);<i>at birth: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>0-14 years: </i>1.04 male(s)/female<br /><i>15-24 years: </i>1.03 male(s)/female<br /><i>25-54 years: </i>0.97 male(s)/female<br /><i>55-64 years: </i>0.93 male(s)/female<br /><i>65 years and over: </i>0.66 male(s)/female<br /><i>total population: </i>0.93 male(s)/female (2014 est.);29 deaths/100,000 live births (2010);<i>total: </i>8.97 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>male: </i>9.95 deaths/1,000 live births<br /><i>female: </i>7.95 deaths/1,000 live births (2014 est.);<i>total population: </i>76.81 years<br /><i>male: </i>73.67 years<br /><i>female: </i>80.06 years (2014 est.);77%<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>percent of women aged 15-50 (2004);1.84 children born/woman (2014 est.);8% of GDP (2011);3.74 physicians/1,000 population (2008);3 beds/1,000 population (2011);<i>improved: </i>urban: 99.9% of population<br />rural: 94.9% of population<br />total: 99.5% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 0.1% of population<br />rural: 5.1% of population<br />total: 0.5% of population (2012 est.);<i>improved: </i>urban: 96.5% of population<br />rural: 95.8% of population<br />total: 96.4% of population<br /><i>unimproved: </i>urban: 3.5% of population<br />rural: 4.2% of population<br />total: 3.6% of population (2012 est.);0.7% (2012 est.);13,200 (2012 est.);NA;;24.8% (2008);4.5% (2011);4.5% of GDP (2011);<i>definition: </i>age 15 and over can read and write<br /><i>total population: </i>98.1%<br /><i>male: </i>97.6%<br /><i>female: </i>98.5% (2010 est.);<i>total: </i>16 years<br /><i>male: </i>14 years<br /><i>female: </i>17 years (2010);;<i>total: </i>18.5%<br /><i>male: </i>14.7%<br /><i>female: </i>23.6% (2012);;<i>total number: </i>51,879<br /><i>percentage: </i>7 % (2006 est.);<i>conventional long form: </i>Oriental Republic of Uruguay<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>Uruguay<br /><i>local long form: </i>Republica Oriental del Uruguay<br /><i>local short form: </i>Uruguay<br /><i>former: </i>Banda Oriental, Cisplatine Province;;;constitutional republic;;<i>name: </i>Montevideo<br /><i>geographic coordinates: </i>34 51 S, 56 10 W<br /><i>time difference: </i>UTC-3 (2 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)<br /><i>daylight saving time: </i>+1hr, begins first Sunday in October;19 departments (departamentos, singular -

Following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s, economic growth for Uruguay averaged 8% annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated to 2.6% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher public expenditure and investment, and GDP growth reached 8.9% in 2010 but slowed in 2012-13, the result of a renewed slowdown in the global economy and in Uruguay's main trade partners and Common Market of the South (Mercosur) counterparts, Argentina and Brazil. Uruguay has sought to expand trade within Mercosur and with non-Mercosur members. Uruguay's total merchandise trade with Mercosur since 2006 has increased by nearly 70% to more than $5 billion while its total trade with the world has almost doubled to roughly $23 billion in

Fueled by high oil prices, pre-election government spending helped spur GDP growth in 2012 to 5.6%. Government spending, minimum wage hikes, and improved access to domestic credit created an increase in consumption which combined with supply problems to cause higher inflation - roughly 20% in 2012 and rising to more than 56% in 2013. Former President Hugo CHAVEZ's efforts to increase the government's control of the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial, construction, oil, and steel sectors hurt the private investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed non-petroleum exports. In 2013, Venezuela continued to wrestle with housing and electricity crises, and rolling food and goods shortages, resulting from the government's unorthodox economic policies. The budget deficit for the public sector reached 17% of GDP in 2012 and was trimmed to under 10% of GDP in 2013. The Venezuelan government has maintained a regime of strict currency exchange controls since 2003. Venezuelan law now sanctions a three-tiered exchange rate system, with rates based on the government's import priorities.;$407.4 billion (2013 est.)<br />$403.3 billion (2012 est.)<br />$381.9 billion

248;Afghanistan;Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn Conference in 2001 established a process for political reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in 2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was inaugurated the following December. KARZAI was re-elected in August 2009 for a second term. Despite gains toward building a stable central government, a resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial instability - particularly in the south and the east - remain serious challenges for the Afghan Government.;;Southern Asia, north and west of Pakistan, east of Iran;33 00 N, 65 00 E;<a

The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service sector growth. Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, weak governance, lack of infrastructure, and the Afghan Government's difficulty in extending rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan's living standards are among the lowest in the world. The international community remains committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging over $67 billion at nine donors' conferences between 2003-10. In July 2012, the donors at the Tokyo conference pledged an additional $16 billion in civilian aid through 2015. Despite this help, the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job creation, high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and poor public infrastructure.

249;Bangladesh;Muslim conversions and settlement in the region now referred to as Bangladesh began in the 10th century, primarily from Arab and Persian traders and preachers. Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area in the 16th century. Eventually the area known as Bengal, primarily Hindu in the western section and mostly Muslim in the eastern half, became part of British India. Partition in 1947 resulted in an eastern wing of Pakistan in the Muslim-majority area, which became East Pakistan. Calls for greater autonomy and animosity between the eastern and western wings of Pakistan led to a Bengali independence movement. That movement, led by the Awami League (AL) and supported by India, won independence for Bangladesh in a brief war in 1971, during which at least 300,000 civilians died. The post-independence, AL government faced daunting challenges and in 1975 was overthrown by the military, triggering a series of military coups that resulted in a military-backed government and subsequent creation of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). That government also ended in a coup in 1981, followed by military-backed rule until democratic elections in 1991. The BNP and AL have alternately held power since then, with the exception of a military-backed, emergency caretaker regime that suspended parliamentary elections planned for January 2007 in an effort to reform the political system and root out corruption. That government returned the country to fully democratic rule in December 2008 with the election of the AL and Prime Minister Sheikh HASINA. In January 2014, the AL won the national election by an overwhelming majority after the BNP boycotted, extending HASINA's term as prime minister.

Although more than half of GDP is generated through the service sector, almost half of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector with rice as the single-most-important product. Garment exports, the backbone of Bangladesh’s industrial sector and 80% of total exports, surpassed $21 billion last year, 18% of GDP. The sector has remained resilient in recent years amidst a series of factory accidents that have killed over 1,000 workers and crippling strikes that shut down virtually all economic activity. Steady garment export growth combined with remittances from overseas Bangladeshis, which totaled almost $15 billion and 13% of GDP IN 2013, are the largest contributors to Bangladesh’s current account surplus and record foreign exchange holdings.;$324.6 billion (2013 est.)<br />$307 billion (2012 est.)<br />$289.2 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$140.2 billion (2013 est.);5.8% (2013 est.)<br />6.1% (2012 est.)<br />6.5% (2011 est.);$2,100 (2013 est.)<br />$2,000 (2012 est.)<br />$1,900 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;28.3% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />27% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />25% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>75.3%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>5.7%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>25.6%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>3.6%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>24.5%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-34.7%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>17.2%<br /><i>industry: </i>28.9%<br /><i>services: </i>53.9% (2013 est.);rice, jute, tea, wheat, sugarcane, potatoes, tobacco, pulses, oilseeds, spices, fruit;jute, cotton, garments, paper, leather, fertilizer, iron and steel, cement, petroleum products, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, tea, salt, sugar, edible oils, soap and detergent, fabricated metal products, electricity, natural gas;9% (2013 est.);78.62 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>extensive export of labor to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Qatar, and Malaysia;<i>agriculture: </i>47%<br /><i>industry: </i>13%<br /><i>services: </i>40% (2010 est.);5% (2013 est.)<br />5% (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>about 40% of the population is underemployed;<i>lowest 10%: </i>4%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>27% (2010 est.);31.5% (2010 est.);32.1 (2010)<br />33.6 (1996);<i>revenues: </i>$17.19 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$24.02 billion (2013 est.);12.3% of GDP (2013 est.);-4.9% of GDP (2013 est.);30.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />32.2% of GDP (2012 est.);1 July -

Because rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive, industrial production is primarily of the cottage industry type. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and is dependent on India for financial assistance and migrant laborers for development projects, especially for road construction. Multilateral development organizations administer most educational, social, and environment programs, and take into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. Bhutan’s largest export - hydropower to India - is creating employment and will probably sustain growth in the coming years. Only 5% of Bhutan’s 30,000 megawatt hydropower potential is currently tapped. The large amount of equipment needed to import materials to build hydropower plants has expanded Bhutan's trade and current account deficits. Bhutan’s GDP has rebounded strongly since the global recession began in 2008. Bhutan hopes to play a larger role in regional economic integration as a member of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation.;$5.235 billion (2013 est.)<br />$4.947 billion (2012 est.)<br />$4.529 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$2.133 billion (2013 est.);5.8% (2013 est.)<br />9.2% (2012 est.)<br />8.5% (2011 est.);$7,000 (2013 est.)<br />$6,700 (2012 est.)<br />$6,100 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;29.6% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />29.1% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />29.2% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>37.9%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>21.3%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>64%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>-0.1%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>28.6%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-51.7%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>13.8%<br /><i>industry: </i>41.2%<br /><i>services: </i>45% (2013 est.);rice, corn, root crops, citrus;cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages, calcium carbide, tourism;7% (2013 est.);336,400<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>major shortage of skilled labor (2012);<i>agriculture: </i>62%<br /><i>industry: </i>19%<br /><i>services: </i>19% (2012 est.);2.1% (2013)<br />4% (2009);<i>lowest 10%: </i>2.3%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>37.6% (2003);12% (2012);38.7<br />38.1;<i>revenues: </i>$588.2 million<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$639.5 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>the government of India finances nearly one-quarter of Bhutan's budget expenditures (2013 est.);27.6% of GDP (2013 est.);-2.4% of GDP (2013 est.);38.9% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />44.1% of GDP (2012 est.);1 July - 30 June;11% (2013 est.)<br />10.9% (2012 est.);NA%;14% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />14% (31 December 2012 est.);$224.9 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$191.9 million (31 December 2012 est.);$1.099 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$1.062 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$915 million (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$874.4 million (31 December 2012 est.);$NA<br />$283.4 million;$401.5 million (2013 est.)<br />-$311.6 million (2012 est.);$721.8 million (2012 est.)<br />$662.2 million (2011 est.);electricity (to India), ferrosilicon, cement, calcium carbide, copper wire, manganese, vegetable oil;India 83.8%, Hong Kong 10.8% (2013 est.);$1.28 billion (2012 est.)<br />$1.185 billion (2011 est.);fuel and lubricants, passenger cars, machinery and parts, fabrics, rice;India 72.3%, South Korea 6% (2013 est.);;$1.275 billion (2011)<br />$836 million (2009);$63.5 million;;ngultrum (BTN) per US dollar -<br />56.61 (2013 est.)<br />53.44 (2012 est.)<br />45.73 (2010 est.)<br />46.68 (2009 est.)<br />43.51 (2008 est.);;7.23 billion kWh (2010 est.);1.68 billion kWh (2010 est.);5.4 billion kWh (2010 est.);20 million kWh (2010 est.);1.505 million kW (2010 est.);1.1% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);98.9% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,719 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);1,998 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);335,700 Mt (2011 est.);27,000 (2012);560,000 (2012);<i>general assessment: </i>urban towns and district headquarters have telecommunications services<br /><i>domestic: </i>low teledensity;state-owned TV station established in 1999;.bt;14,590 (2012);50,000 (2009);;2 (2013);<i>total: </i>2<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>1 (2012);;;;<i>total: </i>8,050 km<br /><i>paved: </i>4,991 km (includes 622 km of expressways)<br /><i>unpaved: </i>3,059 km (2003);;;;;Royal Bhutan Army (includes Royal Bodyguard and Royal Bhutan Police) (2009);18 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>202,407<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>180,349 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>157,664<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>144,861 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>7,363<br /><i>female: </i>7,095 (2010 est.);;;lacking any treaty describing the boundary, Bhutan and China continue negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment to resolve territorial disputes arising from substantial cartographic discrepancies, the largest of which lie in Bhutan's northwest and along the Chumbi salient;;;
251;British Indian Ocean Territory;Formerly administered as part of the British Crown Colony of Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was established as an overseas territory of the UK in 1965. A number of the islands of the territory were later transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976. Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Between 1967 and 1973, former agricultural workers, earlier residents in the islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius, but also to the Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as compensation for the displaced islanders, known as Chagossians. Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits against the British Government seeking further compensation and the right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007, British court rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia. In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal in the UK, ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower court rulings and finding no right of return for the Chagossians.;;archipelago in the Indian Ocean, south of India, about halfway between Africa and Indonesia;6 00 S, 71 30 E;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/pdf/world.pdf">Political Map of the World</a>;<i>total: </i>54,400 sq km<br /><i>land: </i>60 sq km;land area is about 0.3 times the size of Washington, DC;0 km;698 km;<i>territorial sea: </i>3 nm<br /><i>exclusive fishing zone: </i>200 nm;tropical marine;flat and low (most areas do not exceed two meters in elevation);<i>lowest point: </i>Indian Ocean 0 m<br /><i>highest point: </i>unnamed location on Diego Garcia 15 m;coconuts, fish, sugarcane;<i>arable land: </i>0%<br /><i>permanent crops: </i>0%<br /><i>other: </i>100% (2011);;;;NA;NA;;archipelago of 55 islands;;;;;;no indigenous inhabitants<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>approximately 1,200 former agricultural workers resident in the Chagos Archipelago, often referred to as Chagossians or Ilois, were relocated to Mauritius and the Seychelles in the 1960s and 1970s;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;<i>conventional long form: </i>British Indian Ocean Territory<br /><i>conventional short form: </i>none<br /><i>abbreviation: </i>BIOT;;overseas territory of the UK;;;;;;;;;;the laws of the UK, where applicable, apply;;;<i>chief of state: </i>Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952)<br /><i>head of government: </i>Commissioner Colin ROBERTS (since July 2008);;;;;;none (overseas territory of the UK);none (overseas territory of the UK);white with six blue wavy horizontal stripes;;;;All economic activity is concentrated on the largest island of Diego Garcia, where a joint UK-US military facility is located.

Economic liberalization measures, including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and served to accelerate the country's growth, which averaged under 7% per year from 1997 to 2011. India's diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of services. Slightly less than half of the work force is in agriculture, but, services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for nearly two-thirds of India's output with less than one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services, business outsourcing services, and software workers. India's economic growth began slowing in 2011 because of a decline in investment, caused by high interest rates, rising inflation, and investor pessimism about the government's commitment to further economic reforms and about the global situation. In late 2012, the Indian Government announced additional reforms and deficit reduction measures, including allowing higher levels of foreign participation in direct investment in the economy. The outlook for India's long-term growth is moderately positive due to a young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing integration into the global economy. However, India has many challenges that it has yet to fully address, including poverty, corruption, violence and discrimination against women and girls, an inefficient power generation and distribution system, ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights, decades-long civil litigation dockets, inadequate transport and agricultural infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment opportunities, high spending and poorly-targeted subsidies, inadequate availability of quality basic and higher education, and accommodating rural-to-urban migration. Growth in 2013 fell to a decade low, as India's economic leaders struggled to improve the country's wide fiscal and current account deficits. Rising macroeconomic imbalances in India and improving economic conditions in Western countries, led investors to shift capital away from India, prompting a sharp depreciation of the rupee. However, investors' perceptions of India improved in early 2014, due to a reduction of the current account deficit and expectations of post-election economic reform, resulting in a surge of inbound capital flows and stabilization of the rupee.;$4.99 trillion (2013 est.)<br />$4.833 trillion (2012 est.)<br />$4.63 trillion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$1.67

253;Maldives;A sultanate since the 12th century, the Maldives became a British protectorate in 1887. It became a republic in 1968, three years after independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated the islands' political scene for 30 years, elected to six successive terms by single-party referendums. Following political demonstrations in the capital Male in August 2003, the president and his government pledged to embark upon a process of liberalization and democratic reforms, including a more representative political system and expanded political freedoms. Progress was sluggish, however, and many promised reforms were slow to be realized. Nonetheless, political parties were legalized in 2005.

of GDP and more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts. Fishing is the second leading sector, but the fish catch has dropped sharply in recent years. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Lower than expected tourist arrivals and fish exports, combined with high government spending on social needs, subsidies, and civil servant salaries contributed to a balance of payments crisis, which was temporarily eased with a $79.3 million IMF Stand-By agreement. However, after the first two disbursements, the IMF withheld subsequent disbursements due to concerns over Maldives' growing budget deficit, and the government has been seeking other sources of budgetary support ever since. A new Goods and Services Tax (GST) on tourism introduced in January 2011, on general goods and services in October 2011, and a new Business Profit Tax introduced in July 2011 have provided a boost to revenue. In recent years, gross foreign reserves have hovered around $300 million, sufficient to finance about two to three months of imports. Diversifying the economy beyond tourism and fishing, reforming public finance, increasing employment opportunities, and combating corruption, cronyism, and a growing drug problem are other near-term challenges facing the government.

254;Nepal;In 1951, the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of government. Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. The ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute power by the king in 2002. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists and government officials, and culminated in a late 2006 peace accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a nationwide election in April 2008, the newly formed Constituent Assembly (CA) declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished the monarchy at its first meeting the following month. The CA elected the country's first president in July. Between 2008 and 2011 there were four different coalition governments, led twice by the United Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist, which received a plurality of votes in the 2008 CA election, and twice by the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist (UML). After the CA failed to draft a constitution by the May 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court, then Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of negotiations ensued until March 2013 when the major political parties agreed to create an interim government headed by then Chief Justice Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA. Elections were held in November 2013, in which and the Nepali Congress won the largest share of the seats in the CA and in February 2014 formed a coalition government with the second place UML and with Nepali Congress President Sushil KOIRALA as prime minister;;Southern Asia, between China and India;28 00 N, 84 00 E;<a

Nepal is heavily dependent on remittances, which amount to as much as 22-25% of GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for more than 70% of the population and accounting for a little over one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses, jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of commercially feasible capacity, but political uncertainty and a difficult business climate have hampered foreign investment. Additional challenges to Nepal's growth include its landlocked geographic location, persistent power shortages, underdeveloped transportation infrastructure, civil strife and labor unrest, and its susceptibility to natural disaster. The lack of political consensus in the past several years has delayed national budgets and prevented much-needed economic reform, although the government passed a full budget in 2013.;$42.06 billion (2013 est.)<br />$40.57 billion (2012 est.)<br />$38.7 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$19.34 billion (2013 est.);3.6% (2013 est.)<br />4.9% (2012 est.)<br />3.4% (2011 est.);$1,500 (2013 est.)<br />$1,500 (2012 est.)<br />$1,400 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;;<i>household consumption: </i>81.2%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>10%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>21.6%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>14.6%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>10.3%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-37.7%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>36.8%<br /><i>industry: </i>14.5%<br /><i>services: </i>48.7% (2013 est.);pulses, rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, jute, root crops;tourism, carpets, textiles;1.5% (2013 est.);16 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>severe lack of skilled labor (2011 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>75%<br /><i>industry: </i>7%<br /><i>services: </i>18% (2010 est.);46% (2008 est.)<br />42% (2004 est.);<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.2%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>29.5% (2011);25.2% (2011 est.);32.8 (2010)<br />47.2 (2008 est.);<i>revenues: </i>$3.3 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$3.9 billion (FY12/13);17.1% of GDP (FY12/13);-3.1% of GDP (FY12/13);28% of GDP (FY11/12);16 July - 15 July;NA% (2013 est.)<br />9.5% (2012 est.);6% (31 December 2010 est.)<br />6.5% (31 December 2009 est.);9% (31 December 2013 est.)<br />8% (31 December 2012 est.);$3.553 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$3.104 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$11.49 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$11.71 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$13.46 billion (31 December 2013 est.)<br />$11.88 billion (31 December 2012 est.);$4.16 billion (31 December 2012 est.)<br />$3.849 billion (31 December 2011)<br />$5.235 billion (31 December 2010 est.);$648 million (2013 est.)<br />$283.9 million (2012 est.);$1.06 billion (2013 est.)<br />$1.004 billion (2012 est.);clothing, pulses, carpets, textiles, juice, pashima, jute goods;India 93.9%, Bangladesh 4%, Italy 0.4% (2013 est.);$6.329 billion (2013 est.)<br />$5.951 billion (2012 est.);petroleum products, machinery and equipment, gold, electrical goods, medicine;India 79.4%, South Korea 3.1%, China 2.5% (2013 est.);$6.574 billion (15 January 2014 est.)<br />$5.833 billion (15 July 2013 est.);$3.956 billion (31 December 2011 est.)<br />$3.673 billion (31 December 2010 est.);$103 million;$NA;Nepalese rupees (NPR) per US dollar -<br />87.96 (2013 est.)<br />85.2 (2012 est.)<br />73.16 (2010 est.)<br />77.44 (2009)<br />65.21 (2008);;3.431 billion kWh (2012 est.);2.745 billion kWh (2010 est.);30 million kWh (2010 est.);694 million kWh (2010 est.);721,000 kW (2010 est.);7.9% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);92.1% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0% of total installed capacity (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2012 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 bbl (1 January 2013 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);18,430 bbl/day (2011 est.);0 bbl/day (2010 est.);21,960 bbl/day (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2010 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (2011 est.);0 cu m (1 January 2013 est.);3.173 million Mt (2011 est.);834,000 (2013);18.138 million (2013);<i>general assessment: </i>poor telephone and telegraph service;state operates 2 TV stations as well as national and regional radio stations;.np;41,256 (2012);577,800 (2009);;47 (2013);<i>total: </i>11<br /><i>over 3,047 m: </i>1<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>3<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>6<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>1 (2013);<i>total: </i>36<br /><i>1,524 to 2,437 m: </i>1<br /><i>914 to 1,523 m: </i>6<br /><i>under 914 m: </i>29 (2013);;;<i>total: </i>59 km<br /><i>narrow gauge: </i>59 km 0.762-m gauge (2008);<i>total: </i>10,844 km<br /><i>paved: </i>4,952 km<br /><i>unpaved: </i>5,892 km (2010);;;;;Nepal Army (2012);18 years of age for voluntary military service;<i>males age 16-49: </i>6,941,152<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>7,618,397 (2010 est.);<i>males age 16-49: </i>5,260,878<br /><i>females age 16-49: </i>5,947,512 (2010 est.);<i>male: </i>380,172<br /><i>female: </i>367,103 (2010 est.);NA% (2012)<br />1.41% of GDP (2011)<br />NA% (2010);;joint border commission continues to work on contested sections of boundary with India, including the 400 sq km dispute over the source of the Kalapani River;<i>refugees (country of origin): </i>15,0000-20,000 (Tibet/China) (2013);;illicit producer of cannabis and hashish for the domestic and international drug markets
255;Pakistan;The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what is presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and Turks.

Agriculture accounts for more than one-fifth of output and two-fifths of employment. Textiles account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, and Pakistan's failure to expand a viable export base for other manufactures has left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Official unemployment was 6.6% in 2013, but this fails to capture the true picture, because much of the economy is informal and underemployment remains high. Over the past few years, low growth and high inflation, led by a spurt in food prices, have increased the amount of poverty. As a result of political and economic instability, the Pakistani rupee has depreciated more than 40% since 2007. The government agreed to an International Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement in November 2008 in response to a balance of payments crisis. Although the economy has stabilized since the crisis, it has failed to recover. Foreign investment has not returned, due to investor concerns related to governance, energy, security, and a slow-down in the global economy. Remittances from overseas workers, averaging about $1 billion a month since March 2011, remain a bright spot for Pakistan. However, after a small current account surplus in fiscal year 2011 (July 2010/June 2011), Pakistan's current account turned to deficit in the following two years, spurred by higher prices for imported oil and lower prices for exported cotton. Pakistan remains stuck in a low-income, low-growth trap, with growth averaging about 3.5% per year from 2008 to 2013. Pakistan must address long standing issues related to government revenues and energy production in order to spur the amount of economic growth that will be necessary to employ its growing and rapidly urbanizing population, more than half of which is under 22. Other long term challenges include expanding investment in education and healthcare, adapting to the effects of climate change and natural disasters, and reducing dependence on foreign donors.;$574.1 billion (2013 est.)<br />$554.2 billion (2012 est.)<br />$531 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;$236.5 billion (2013 est.);3.6% (2013 est.)<br />4.4% (2012 est.)<br />3.7% (2011 est.);$3,100 (2013 est.)<br />$3,100 (2012 est.)<br />$3,000 (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>data are in 2013 US dollars;12.7% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />13.3% of GDP (2012 est.)<br />12.9% of GDP (2011 est.);<i>household consumption: </i>81%<br /><i>government consumption: </i>10.8%<br /><i>investment in fixed capital: </i>12.6%<br /><i>investment in inventories: </i>1.6%<br /><i>exports of goods and services: </i>12.7%<br /><i>imports of goods and services: </i>-18.8%<br />(2013 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>25.3%<br /><i>industry: </i>21.6%<br /><i>services: </i>53.1% (2013 est.);cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables;textiles and apparel, food processing, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, paper products, fertilizer, shrimp;3.5% (2013 est.);59.21 million<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>extensive export of labor, mostly to the Middle East, and use of child labor (2012 est.);<i>agriculture: </i>45.1%<br /><i>industry: </i>20.7%<br /><i>services: </i>34.2% (2010 est.);6.6% (2013 est.)<br />6% (2012 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>substantial underemployment exists;<i>lowest 10%: </i>3.9%<br /><i>highest 10%: </i>39.3% (FY05/06);22.3% (FY05/06 est.);30.6 (FY07/08)<br />41 (FY98/99);<i>revenues: </i>$29.71 billion<br /><i>expenditures: </i>$47.97 billion (2013 est.);12.6% of GDP (2013 est.);-7.7% of GDP (2013 est.);54.6% of GDP (2013 est.)<br />52.1% of GDP (2012 est.);1 July -

256;Sri Lanka;The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown colony in 1802, and was formally united under British rule by 1815.

The government has been pursuing large-scale reconstruction and development projects in its efforts to spur growth in war-torn and disadvantaged areas, develop small and medium enterprises and increase agricultural productivity. The government's high debt payments and bloated civil service have contributed to historically high budget deficits, but fiscal consolidation efforts and strong GDP growth in recent years have helped bring down the government's fiscal deficit. However, low tax revenues are a major concern. The 2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis. Agriculture slowed due to a drought and weak global demand affected exports and trade. In early 2012, Sri Lanka floated the rupee, resulting in a sharp depreciation, and took steps to curb imports. A large trade deficit remains a concern, but strong remittances from Sri Lankan workers abroad help offset the trade deficit. Government debt of about 80% of GDP remains among the highest in emerging markets.;$134.5 billion (2013 est.)<br />$126.6 billion (2012 est.)<br />$119 billion (2011 est.)<br /><i><b>note:</b>

Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western Australia.

Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of the US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru.

261;Southern Ocean;A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica, plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation. The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons, but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients, which promotes marine plant life, and which, in turn, allows for a greater abundance of animal life. In 2000, the International Hydrographic Organization delimited the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude, which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such, the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, but larger than the Arctic Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary oceans by the US Government.;;body of water between 60 degrees south latitude and Antarctica;60 00 S, 90 00 E (nominally), but the Southern Ocean has the unique distinction of being a large circumpolar body of water totally encircling the continent of Antarctica;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/antarctic.pdf">Antarctic Region</a>;<i>total: </i>20.327 million sq km<br /><i><b>note:</b> </i>includes Amundsen Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, part of the Drake Passage, Ross Sea, a small part of the Scotia Sea, Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies;slightly more than twice the size of the US;;17,968 km;;sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius;the Southern Ocean is deep, 4,000 to 5,000 m over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water;<i>lowest point: </i>-7,235 m at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench<br /><i>highest point: </i>sea level 0 m;probable large and possible giant oil and gas fields on the continental margin;;;;;huge icebergs with drafts up to several hundred meters;increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole in recent years, reducing marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and damaging the DNA of some fish;the Southern Ocean is subject to all international agreements regarding the world's oceans;the major chokepoint is the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Fisheries in 2006-07 landed 126,976 metric tons, of which 82% (104,586 tons) was krill (Euphausia superba) and 9.5% (12,027 tons) Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides - also known as Chilean sea bass), compared to 127,910 tons in 2005-06 of which 83% (106,591 tons) was krill and 9.7% (12,396 tons) Patagonian toothfish (estimated fishing from the area covered by the Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which extends slightly beyond the Southern Ocean area).
