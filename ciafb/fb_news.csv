The fields for Electricity Flows (production, consumption, exports, and imports) remain the same as before, but there are now five new stock measures for Installed Electricity Generating Capacity, including total installed capacity (measured in kilowatts) and a percentage breakdown of the four main sources of that capacity: fossil fuel plants, nuclear plants, hydroelectric plants, and renewable fuel sources, such as solar and wind.

The definitions for each of the five natural gas fields are identical to what had previously appeared in the Economy category. Finally, a new field for &quot;Carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of energy&quot; measures the total output of carbon dioxide from the consumption of all fuels.
